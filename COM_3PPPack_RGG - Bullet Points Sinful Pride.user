  <thing id="fSFPridefl" name="Prideful" description="You have turned your love of your own sense of accomplishment and self-worth into an art form&#133; and a power.\n\n{b}Prerequisite{/b}: Cha 13.\n \n{b}Benefit{/b}: Your conviction that you are superior to those around you gives you a major boost of self-confidence whenever you encounter evidence to support your massive sense of self-worth. When you roll a natural 20 on an ability check, skill check, attack roll, or saving throw (the die result is a 20), or a foe rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw against an effect or spell of yours, or on an opposed skill check against you, you receive a +1 morale bonus to one of the following (selected at the time you gain the bonus): ability and skill checks tied to Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma (your choice); caster level; or weapon damage. You can only have one bonus from Prideful in effect at a time, and if you use the ability again before an old bonus fades, the original bonus immediately ends." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fSFBttrAny" name="Better Than Anyone" description="Your massive pride drives you to overcome anyone you are directly competing against.\n\n{b}Prerequisite{/b}: Prideful, Cha 13.\n \n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you are making an opposed skill check (such as Stealth against a foe&#146;s Perception, or Bluff against a foe&#146;s Sense Motive), and you are aware of who is making the check opposing you and what skill they are using, you receive a +3 bonus to your skill check.\n\nFor example, Lord Brevic has Better Than Anyone, and is trying to sneak past Lady Khurva. Since he knows this is his Stealth check opposed by Khurva&#146;s Perception check, he receives a +3 bonus. If Lady Khurva attempts to sneak past Lord Brevic, he doesn&#146;t know who his Perception check is opposed by, and gains no bonus. If Brevic and Khurva are playing hide-and-seek and the GM rules this is a set of matching opposed Perception and stealth checks, Brvice gains the bonus to both checks." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

You must take the second result, even if it is worse. If your check or roll still fails, you suffer a -2 penalty on checks or rolls of that type (ability check, skill check, or attack roll) for 12 hours." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

You may use dispel magic to counterspell a spell-like or supernatural ability. You must correctly identify the ability with either a Spellcraft check (setting the DC as if you were identifying a spell of the same level as the spell-like ability) or an appropriate Knowledge check for creatures using supernatural abilities (DC 10 + creature&#146;s CR). You must make a caster level check with a DC of 11 + the abilities caster level (if given) or 11 + the hit dice of the creature using the ability. Except as noted above, this ability works as a dispel magic used to counterspell a spell." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">
