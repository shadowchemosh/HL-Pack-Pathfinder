The unseen servant can’t actually exceed its normal limits of Strength or skill, but takes such minor actions as might increase the verisimilitude of an illusion without further instruction from you. \n\nThis increases the save DC of an illusion (figment) spell it augments by 1. (If you also have the Greater Servant feat, the DC increase is +2.)\nAdditionally, if you have an unseen servant in effect and adjacent to you, you gain a +3 bonus to all Sleight of Hand checks you make.\n\nNormal: While an unseen servant could be instructed to do something specific that might augment the realism of an illusion (figment) spell (at the GM’s discretion), it would normally only be able to do one thing at a time and require instruction from you for each separate thing it was to do, making it much less effective." compset="Feat" summary="You can use your unseen servant to lend credibility to your illusions." uniqueness="useronce">

The spell is considered to have beencast by that character for all purposes except caster level. The spell effect does its best to remain adjacent to the character you assign it to, and must remain within short range of that character or wink out of existence (though it no longer has to remain in range of you). Each\nround the unseen servant can take one item given to it by the character it serves and stow it safely away on the character, or it can prepare a\nweapon or piece of equipment for the character. This allows the character to accept or pass of held items as free action (though only to the\nlimit of the unseen servant’s ability to take or put away one item per round). Alternatively each round the unseen servant can load a rossbow\nor firearm (which always takes maximum time, regardless of what feats or abilities the character it is serving has), carry a shield that weighs 20 lbs or less to protect the character it serves (which never gives more than a +1 shield bonus to AC, regardless of the properties of the shield), or apply a potion to the character it is serving (though this is a separate action from readying a potion, limiting the unseen servant\nto one potion every two rounds). Efforts to remove or damage items held by the unseen servant are handled as disarm, steal, or sunder maneuvers against the character it is serving, but such maneuvers never provoke attacks of opportunity (as the unseen servant cannot\nmake attacks) and receive a +4 circumstance bonus to their CMB check." compset="Feat" summary="You can order your unseen servant to help another character." uniqueness="useronce">
