  <thing id="fDistMvtBP" name="Disturbing Movements" description="The disjointed, uneven, jerky way you move strains the mind of those who see you.\n\nBenefit: The obviously unnatural style of your movements is unsettling if seen clearly. Whenever you take a full attack action or a full move action, all non-undead within 30 feet who are able to see you must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier) or be shaken for 2d4 rounds. This ability does not stack with other fear effects (it never creates conditions worse than shaken), and a creature can only fail its saving throw against this ability once per day. This is a mind-affecting fear effect." compset="Feat" summary="The disjointed, uneven, jerky way you move strains the mind of those who see you." uniqueness="useronce">

Creatures and objects in this radius may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier) for half damage.

Creatures in this area must make Reflex saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier)or be exposed to the slimy doom disease, except its save DC is the same as this ability&apos;s Reflex save DC, and a creature killed by it becomes an undead of the same type as you. (See below and the PFRPG Core Rulebook, p.557, for more information on slimy doom.) You may use this ability once per day, plus once per day for every 4 HD you possess.\n\nSlimy Doom\nType: disease, contact; Save: Fortitude DC see above\nOnset: 1 day; Frequency: 1/day\nEffect: 1d4 Con damage, target must make a second Fort save or 1 point of the damage is drain instead\nCure: 2 consecutive saves" compset="Feat" summary="When you are damaged, you spray a putrid fluid from your rotting flesh." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fStagConBP" name="Staggering Consequences" description="Energy damage tends to stick to you, and harm those around you.\n\nBenefit: When you take acid, cold, electricity or fire damage, your body becomes engulfed in energy of that type (acid clings to your skin and is splattered as you move about, ice forms a mist around you, you become a walking lightning rod, or you burst into flames). You deal 1d6 damage of the same energy type to all creatures in adjacent spaces. No creature can be damaged by this more than once per round. This gives you no immunity to the energy damage, it just creates a damaging aura around you.

  <thing id="fWpnBindBP" name="Weapon Bind" description="Your animate corpse often catches on weapons stuck in it.\n\nBenefit: The weapons of your foes often get stuck in your body, forcing them to take extra time to pull their weapons free. When a foe successfully attacks you with a held melee weapon, as an immediate action you may make a CMB check against the foe. You gain a +4 bonus to your CMB check against piercing weapons and take a -4 penalty against bludgeoning weapons. On a successful check, the weapon is stuck in your dead flesh, and cannot be used until it is freed. Freeing a weapon requires its wielder taking a standard action to make a Strength check (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Str modifier), or a successful CMB check against your CMD. You may use this ability once per day, plus once per day for every 4 HD you possess." compset="Feat" summary="Your animate corpse often catches on weapons stuck in it." uniqueness="useronce">

Your shadow acts as a shadow (the undead creature) totally loyal to you, with HD equal to the level of the cohort you would receive if you had the Leadership feat (see below and PFRPG Core Rulebook, p.129). Your shadow can reattach itself to you as a swift action, and is immune to all damage and all effects while acting as your normal shadow. It heals itself of hp equal to your HD for every 24 hours it remains attached to you.
