It may leave the psicrystal at any time as a free action, and you may free it at any time as a full-round action. If your psicrystal is destroyed, the spirit is immediately freed from it.\n\nThree times per day, while the spirit is bound within your psicrystal, you may draw on its essence for power – choosing one of the following abilities. Each of these abilities takes a standard action to activate, is a psi-like effect, and functions at your manifester level. For each bonus you take, you owe one of the following to the spirit, to be paid within the next 24 hours: a part of your dreams (you must rest one additional hour to regain power points), some of your memories (you must spend one uninterrupted hour doing nothing but sitting and reminiscing), or a part of your soul (you gain one negative level). If you do not pay the spirit within the next 24 hours, you lose all benefits of this feat and cannot benefit from it again for one week.\n\n• Gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per manifester level.\n\n• Gain a bonus equal to 2 times your manifester level on the next attack roll you make. This attack must be before the end of your next turn, or the bonus is lost.\n\n• Sustain you for 24 hours without food and water, as if using {i}sustenance{/i}.\n\n• Form a ghostly weapon. This weapon is a quasi-real masterwork melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may make attacks with this weapon as normal, dealing normal damage, except that this weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects. This effect ends if the weapon leaves your possession.\n\n• Conceal your form, becoming invisible for a number of minutes equal to your manifester level." compset="Feat" summary="Pay prices to spirits to gain small powers." uniqueness="useronce">

Should your cerebric guardian be destroyed, you gain a new one in 24 hours. A new cerebric guardian must have the same personality as the original, and when created, may choose an additional two personalities.

It is always treated as adjacent to its owner, and cannot be targeted by or included in any effect not originating from its owner.\n\nThis ability replaces flight.\n\n{i}Manifest Mind (Ps):{/i} At 7th level, once per day, you may manifest your cerebric guardian, just as if you were using {i}astral construct{/i}, at a manifester level equal to 1/2 your HD. You spend power points to do so as normal, to a maximum of 1/2 your HD, but this is a supernatural effect and has a duration of 1 hour. While this astral construct exists, it counts as your cerebric guardian and can deliver touch powers for you, but loses all benefits of the piece of mind ability. If your cerebric guardian is destroyed while in this form, you cannot use {i}manifest mind{/i} again for 24 hours, you lose power points equal to your character level and are stunned for one round. This {i}astral construct{/i} cannot venture more than 100 feet from you – if it does so, the {i}astral construct{/i} immediately disperses, returning your cerebric guardian to its original form.\n\nThis ability modifies deliver touch powers.\n\n{i}Form of Fear (Su):{/i} At 13th level, you may use {i}manifest mind{/i} one additional time each day. When you use manifest mind, any enemy within 20 feet of the {i}astral construct{/i} must succeed at a Will save (DC 13 + the primary manifesting ability score modifier of your highest level manifesting class) or be shaken for 5 minutes or until the cerebric guardian is no longer in {i}astral construct{/i} form, whichever happens first.\n\nThis ability replaces sight link.\n\n{b}Note:{/b} This feat&apos;s effects on the psicrystal aren&apos;t currently implemented." compset="Feat" summary="Your psicrystal becomes a spirit you can manifest." uniqueness="useronce">
