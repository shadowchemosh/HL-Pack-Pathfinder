  <thing id="facPWBlkTh" name="Black Thorn Knights" description="{b}Alignment:{/b} Lawful neutral, lawful evil, or neutral evil\n\n{b}Symbol:{/b} An iron gate with thorny vines growing over it; the vines bloom with black roses.\n\n{b}Discipline:{/b} A Black Thorn Knight may trade access to one martial discipline of his choice for access to the Black Seraph discipline.\n\n{b}Oath:{/b} During the course of their training, potential Black Thorn Knights are tasked with growing a rose bush; the flower blooms black and vibrant and is watered repeatedly with the Knight’s own blood. When the Knight is deemed ready by the order, a devil (traditionally an erinyes) is summoned to accept his oath. The fiend hears the Knight’s oath and swears a counteroath on the behalf of Hell, vowing to provide all due support and power to aid the Black Thorn Knight in his mission. A single rose is plucked from the bush the Knight grew and rooted in soil watered with blood from both the Knight and the devil; that rose is spirited away to Hell, there to be kept by the fiend as the visible symbol of his fealty.\n\n  {i}“By my blood and soul do I swear myself as an ally to Hell against the many-faced forces of Chaos. I will revenge myself against those who wrong me, with an eye for an eye and blood for blood, and teach those who come to me seeking the tools to avenge themselves. From me my enemies shall experience neither mercy nor redemption, and I shall drive Chaos before me as the wolf drives the herd to stampede, until the day that I die or its taint is removed from the world.”{/i}\n\n{b}Allegiance Benefit:{/b} In addition to access to the Black Seraph discipline (exchanging a discipline of their choice), Black Thorn Knights enjoy a +2 profane bonus on saving throws vs. spells and abilities that originate from chaotic beings, as well as a +2 profane bonus on saving throws vs. mind-affecting spells and abilities.\n\n  A Black Thorn Knight who violates his oath (see above) loses access to his saving throw bonuses until he atones by sacrificing a sapient being to Hell, or else by punishing himself with fasting and flagellation for seven days. A Black Thorn Knight who ceases to meet the alignment requirements of his order, or who violates his oath and fails to atone within thirty days is in breach of his infernal contract - they lose access to the Black Seraph discipline, the rose kept in Hell withers and dies, and the Black Thorn Knight is marked for life as a debtor to Hell. Any lawful-aligned outsider or Black Thorn Knight in good standing who sees the Knight instantly knows them for an oathbreaker, and devils in particular know the nature of their crime.\n\n  A Black Thorn Knight may still leave the organization in one of two ways. He may breach his infernal contract (see above), or he may invoke the exit clause to leave peacefully, requiring (1000 x level) gold pieces worth of service to the Black Thorn or an equivalent donation. Leaving peacefully in this fashion does not guarantee further peaceful relations; indeed, most would-be retirees of the Black Thorns rightly fear death at the hands of their compatriots or agents of Hell.\n\n[More information available in {i}Path of War{/i}, page 153]" compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

Kneeling in submission before an incarnation of the natural world, the Fang swears his vow and cuts his palms with a wooden blade, leaving behind twin scars that throb angrily in the presence of metal.\n\n{i}“With the earth and sky as my witness, hear my vow: I will serve the untainted wilds and the unspoiled lands, protecting them from the greed of civilization with axe and fang. Where mortal avarice threatens the harmony of nature, I will strike without pity. Where mortal ignorance wracks the land with pain and poison, I will kill without question, and if my heart proves faithless, may I be rejected by stone, scorned by the sky, and driven into the stink and shadows of the cities until my last choked breath of poisoned air.”{/i}\n\n{b}Allegiance Benefit:{/b} In addition to access to the Primal Fury discipline (exchanging a discipline of his choice), Fangs ignore damage reduction possessed by aberrations, constructs, humanoids, monstrous humanoids, oozes, and outsiders (except outsiders with the elemental subtype) and causes regeneration to cease functioning for those creatures if they have that ability.\n\nA Fang that violates his oath (see above) loses his ability to ignore damage reduction and regeneration until he atones either through the sacrifice of a sapient being at the roots of a tree or by flaying himself with thorny vines while meditating on the conflict between civilization and nature (a painful and gory process that inflicts 1d4 points of Constitution damage that the Fang must permit to heal naturally before they are considered to have properly atoned).\n\n[More information available in {i}Path of War{/i}, page 154]" compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

The exact ceremony in which a Defender swears his oath depends on the lord or nation he chooses to serve and has too much potential variety to be detailed here, but the oath is always the same:\n\n{i}“On my honor and the honor of the Defenders who trained me, I swear to be a faithful servant. For you I shall provide valor to defend you and your peoples, loyalty to serve the needs of your realm, courage to destroy your enemies, and cunning to do your will. For me you shall provide honor to reward my deeds, glory to crown my name, and good lordship to sustain my life. So long as the circle is unbroken, my vow remains whole.”{/i}\n\n{b}Allegiance Benefit:{/b} In addition to access to the Iron Tortoise discipline (exchanging a discipline of their choice), Defenders of the Realm benefit from a +2 competence bonus to Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility and royalty), and Knowledge (religion) checks, as well as a +2 competence bonus to Fortitude saves.\n\nDefenders of the Realm who violate their oaths (see above) do not immediately lose access to their bonuses; they have a month’s grace period to atone by making a formal apology to their employer and the order, at which point they must either pay a tithe (200 x level gold pieces) or undertake a mission to restore their good graces. A Defender of the Realm may still atone after this month’s period, but they lose access to their bonuses as the contacts, references, and specialized training made available to them by the Defenders of the Realm cease to be provided. A Defender who ceases to be lawful may not atone until such a time as they have regained their lawful alignment.\n\n[More information available in {i}Path of War{/i}, page 156]" compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

When a Guardian’s training is done and he is deemed ready to go out into the world, his tutors take him to a sacred place. The exact place varies depending on both student and teacher; it might be the site of an act of great heroism, the ruins of a once-holy church, the tomb of a righteous warrior, or a place of great cultural significance to those the student wishes to protect. The student stands vigil for a day and a night with neither food nor water, contemplating the duty he will take upon himself, and then swears the following oath:\n\n{i}“In my own name, unsullied and bound to my virtue, and in the name of Al’asadriel, this I swear: with my blades I shall defend the innocent from those who threaten them wrongfully. With my eyes I shall look for evil and with my words and deeds seek to turn it back to good, or else destroy it. With my mercy and conviction I shall lead others into the light, and with my courage I shall hold back the shadow, until the day I die or Al’asadriel returns to release me.”{/i}\n\n{b}Allegiance Benefit:{/b} In addition to access to the Silver Crane discipline (exchanging a discipline of their choice), Empyreal Guardians enjoy a +2 sacred bonus to saving throws vs. spells and abilities that originate from evil-aligned sources, as well as a +2 morale bonus on saving throws vs. mind-affecting spells and abilities.\n\nAn Empyreal Guardian who violates his oath (see above) loses his bonuses to saving throws until he atones, necessitating a week of fasting and meditation or charitable acts worth a minimum of (200 x level) gold pieces (this might be in donations, equivalent service, etc). An Empyreal Guardian who ceases to be good-aligned may not atone or access the Silver Crane discipline until such a time as they return to their good alignment (though they remain free to change their organization).\n\n[More information available in {i}Path of War{/i}, page 158]" compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

Though the Scarlets who go on to become the guards to royal families and high priests are the most famous, each and every one of the Scarlet Sentinels swears an oath of loyalty and friendship to those they serve with, or that they serve. This intensely private ceremony typically involves only the Scarlet and the ones she swears to, or their representative in some cases. Alone with those to whom they swear their lives, the Scarlet Sentinel cuts her palm and the palms of the others and mingles blood with them, and they gather beneath her upraised weapon while she murmurs her vow:\n\n{i}“By the blood we’ve shared and the blood we’ll spill, I promise this – we’re family, and though I may quarrel with my brothers and sisters, there are none who may quarrel with my brothers and sisters and not also quarrel with me. Your secrets are my secrets, and your dreams are my dreams.

If she is not forgiven within a year and a day (such as by being unable to find the soul of a dead compatriot and beg it for forgiveness) she loses her resistance permanently and is shortly thereafter exiled from the order, who can see her treachery burnt upon the Red Spear.\n\n[More information available in {i}Path of War{/i}, page 159]" compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">
