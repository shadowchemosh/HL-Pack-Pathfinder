Even before the Last War and the dwarves&apos; declaration of independence, various members of the powerful clans had joined together in a secret fraternity designed to increase the wealth and power of its members. With the collapse of Galifar and the rise of the dwarf nation, the members of the Aurum began to look beyond the Ironroot Mountains. Guildmasters, crime lords, merchant princes, nobles, and members of dragonmarked houses, among others, joined the secret society, and slowly it became more than a simple fraternity. Between the infl ux of new blood and the devastation of the Last War came a rush of new ideas, which resulted in a new sense of purpose for the cabal." compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

Older dragons reluctantly allow the Chamber to exist, so long as it keeps a low profi le and doesn&apos;t do anything to endanger the Prophecy or the dragons themselves. To this end, dragons belonging to the Chamber either watch the activities of the lesser races from afar or use magical means to disguise their true nature when they move about in the world of humans." compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

In addition to maintaining the lines of mystical communication that connect the nations of Khorvaire, House Sivis provides translators, notaries, mediators, and advocates to cities across the continent.\n\nAll gnomes are touched with magic, and the scholars of Korranberg have spent thousands of years studying mystical phenomena. When the Mark of Scribing fi rst appeared within the Sivis family twenty-eight hundred years ago, the gnomes were quick to recognize and develop its abilities. Sivis understood the power it possessed, but it also recognized the danger of being perceived as too powerful; thus, those who bore a dragonmark immediately found ways to make themselves useful to society and to distance their house from the politics of the nation.\n\nThe gnomes of House Sivis were among the fi rst of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands.

To the casual observer, House Sivis appears to have no goals beyond expanding its services across Khorvaire.\n\nWithin the house, a constant shadow war for rank and position unfolds. The gnomes do not allow these struggles to interfere with their work or their relations with their fellows; two Sivis gnomes plotting against one another may still go out drinking and have a fine time together. In a sense, the struggles are like an endless game of chess; the gnomes enjoy the game and accept any setback as a new challenge to overcome.\n\nHouse Sivis has two primary operations, the Speakers Guild and the Notaries Guild. The Speakers Guild offers the services of translators, interpreters, mediators, and advocates. In addition, the Speakers Guild maintains the network of message stations through which, for a price, a message can be sent from one station to any other station in Khorvaire. The Notaries Guild deals with written documents. Sivis scribes use {i}arcane mark{/i} to authenticate legal documents, and they also perform transcription, translation, bookkeeping, and copying of texts.

Today, it has been outlawed and is seen as a terrorist organization working at crosspurposes to the legitimate government of the nation. The secret truth beyond the origin of the order and the evil it serves is terrifying.{br}{br}On the surface, the Order of the Emerald Claw appears to consist of a small number of fanatics dedicated to the military superiority of a Karrnath that doesn&apos;t want their devotion. In reality, the order has no interest in promoting or elevating Karrnath. Its true master, hidden to all but the top leaders within the organization, is Vol, the self-styled Queen of the Dead." compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="facS2Royal" name="Royal Families, The" description="King Galifar I established a royal line that continues to rule parts of Khorvaire to the present day. When Galifar united the Five Nations under his banner, he gave each of his five eldest children regency over one of the nations. His descendants continued this practice as age and number of offspring allowed, so that for most of the reigns of the Galifar kings and queens, their children learned leadership by governing parts of the kingdom and were therefore more or less ready to step onto the throne when the king abdicated or died. Succession went to the oldest scion of each generation - at least until the death of King Jarot and the succession struggle that led to the Last War.{br}{br}Today, the descendants of Galifar ir&apos;Wynarn continue to play instrumental roles in Khorvaire. Three of the remaining Five Nations are still ruled by the Wynarn family, and the fourth nation&apos;s royal family, while not on the throne, has some role in the governing of the nation." compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="facS2Twelv" name="Twelve, The" description="An arcane institution funded by the dragonmarked houses, the Twelve operates out of a thirteen-tiered keep that fl oats above the city of Korth in Karrnath. As part of the agreements that ended the War of the Mark, Hadran d&apos;Cannith suggested that the houses work together to create an institute for the application of magic - a foundation that would study dragonmarks and the more traditional forms of arcane magic. The keep was built by Alder d&apos;Cannith, a visionary wizard and master fabricator who used his studies of the sky to determine that the keep should possess thirteen towers.&quot; The moons suggest that the perfect number of dragonmarks is thirteen,&quot; Alder cryptically explained, &quot;but we shall call the institution the Twelve, for the thirteenth mark was cast off long ago.&quot; No one argued with him. (While the elves remember the Mark of Death, it is a topic they wish to forget. Aside from the elf leaders, few know the truth behind the lost dragonmark.) \n\nOver the centuries, the institute has been responsible for many arcane advances. The artificers of the Twelve helped develop the airships operated by House Lyrandar, for example, as well as the message stations of House Sivis." compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="facS2Warde" name="Wardens of the Wood" description="The great forest of the Eldeen Reaches is filled with a dozen druid sects. Each sect consists of druids, rangers, and others who feel a bond to nature, and each has its own beliefs and motivations. The largest and most inf luential of the sects is the Wardens of the Wood. The Wardens are primarily human, but include elves, half-elves, gnomes, and a few members of other races. They guard the plains and forests, protec ting nature and the people living there from all threats - natural and unnatural alike.\n\nThe Great Druid Oalian (N {i}awakened{/i} greatpine, druid 20) is recognized as the ultimate authority in the region by all the sects except for the Gatekeepers. The Wardens of the Wood directly serve Oalian and act as his eyes and ears throughout the region.\n\nThe Wardens of the Wood, like the Gatekeepers, maintain s tatic communities where children are raised and taught. The Wardens of the Wood dominate the region. Over the last three decades they have spread out across the plains as well as continuing to occupy the great forest. The Wardens seek to maintain the balance between civilization and nature. Human, orc, bird, and beast all have a place in the world - they just need to be provided with the proper aid and guidance. The Wardens protect travelers from bandits, rabid beasts, and the aberrations that lurk in the shadows. They have no problem with agriculture and animal husbandry, as long as both land and beast are treated with respect and compassion. They work with farmers and ranchers to ensure that the needs of nature are met." compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">

He led the only expedition ever to reach the Frostfell and return to tell the tale. He wrestled ogres in Droaam, fought chuuls in the Shadow Marches, and was the first half ling to travel to Xen&apos;drik and return. Dayne amassed a fortune in his day, but during his final expedition to Xen&apos;drik he contracted a slow, wasting curse that no magic has been able to reverse. He has a few years of life left, and while he no longer has the strength to explore on his own, he still wants to unlock the mysteries of the unknown. To this end, he dedicated his fortune to establishing the Wayfinder Foundation - a guild for adventurers and explorers that funds dangerous expeditions to exotic locales, as well as giving bold adventurers a place to display their trophies and tell tall tales." compset="Faction" uniqueness="unique">
