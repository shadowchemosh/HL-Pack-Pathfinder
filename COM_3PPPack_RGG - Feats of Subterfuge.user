  <thing id="fTrckMage" name="Trickster Mage" description="You have learned the magic of chicanery and guile.\n\n{b}Prerequisites:{/b} Cha 13, Caster level 5.\n\n{b}Benefit:{/b} You may select 6 spells from the following bonus spell list. The spells selected must be of levels you can cast, and become part of your spell list. You may not select more spells from a level than you have selected from each level below it. (You may take this feat more than once in order to eventually gain higher level spells. See Special, below.)\n\nIf you are a spellcaster with limited spells known (bards and sorcerers, for example), you do not automatically know the spells you select from this list. However, you may learn three of these selected spells and count them as only one spell slot toward your maximum spells known.  This slot must be of the highest level spell being learned. \n\nEach time you make a successful Bluff check in a situation where you cannot take 10 (situations where you are faced with serious threats or distractions), you gain one duplicity mark. As a free action, you may spend a duplicity mark. This allows you to cast one of your known trickster mage spells by spending a spell slot of the same level or higher. You must meet all the normal requirements and components (including casting time) in order to cast the trickster mage spell.\n\nEach day when you rest, recover hit points, and regain uses of your spells, you lose any unused duplicity marks. Any time you fail a\nBluff or Disguise check, or a Linguistics check to pass off a forgery, you lose one duplicity mark.\n\nTrickster Mage Bonus Spell List\n0 level - ghost sound, open/close, prestidigitation\n1st level - disguise self, lesser confusion, silent image, undetectable alignment\n2nd level - alter self, detect thoughts, hypnotic pattern, minor image\n3rd level - phantom trap, soften earth and stone, wood shape\n4th level - major image, meld into stone, stone shape\n5th level - glibness, seeming, transmute rock to mud\n6th level - mislead, modify memory, programmed image\n7th level - insanity, project image, reverse gravity\n8th level - demand, polymorph any object, sympathy\n9th level - summon nature’s ally IX (pixie only), time stop\n\n{b}Special:{/b} This feat may be selected more than once. Each time it allows you to select 6 more spells from the list." compset="Feat" summary="You have learned the magic of chicanery and guile." uniqueness="useronce">
