  <thing id="gS2PotBra" name="Potion Bracer" description="Elite soldiers often carry potions, but in the midst of battle a warrior may not have a free hand or time to locate a particular vial. A potion bracer is a leather band reinforced with strips of steel, with slots for three potion vials. Worn on the forearm, it allows instant hands-free access to these three potions. Drinking a potion from the bracer is a Standard Action, but it does not provoke an Attack of Opportunity or require a warrior to put down his weapon.\n\nThe downside is that unlike a concealed potion, the bracer is very obvious to observers--and it can be directly attacked. A character can make a sunder attack against the bracer (AC 14 + wearer’s Dexterity modifier). The bracer has Hardness 8 and 5 Hit Points. However, any attack that deals 5 or more Hit Points of damage shatters one of the potion vials (chosen randomly) even if the bracer itself is untouched.\n\nDue to the weight placed on the forearm, a potion bracer has an Arcane Spell Failure chance of 5%." compset="Gear">
