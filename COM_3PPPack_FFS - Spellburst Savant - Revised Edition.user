I&apos;m not sure I understand the question...&quot;\n—Tricia MacKorret, a spellburst savant{/i}\n\nMost of the time, when one asks a mage whose magic is the most powerful, the inevitable answer is &quot;my own.&quot; Magicians come in all shapes and size; their styles range from wizardry to sorcery to the divinely-granted clerical arts, psionic reality-warping, and even the supernatural magecraft of many who walk the path of war, and yet this remains an almost-immutable truth. For spellburst savants, the answer is quite different.\n\nTo these mages, magic is as much about the process as it is the result. Spellburst savants possess an instinctive understanding of magical effects, allowing them to tinker and toy with their spells, modulating their components and abilities to fit the situation at hand. They don&apos;t have nearly the same strength as more traditional students of the arcane arts, but they make up for it with sheer understanding.\n\n{b}Role:{/b} The spellburst savant is a spellcaster first and foremost. Her role in an adventuring party is that of a battlefield artillery specialist. Spellburst savants excel at dealing damage and laying down fire support for their allies—often in a very literal fashion.\n\n{b}Starting Wealth:{/b} 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175 gp). In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

  <thing id="cSbSSpells" name="Spells" description="A spellburst savant casts arcane spells drawn from the spellburst savant spell list, which includes all sorcerer/wizard spells from 0th to 5th level, as well as any spells she&apos;s learned with her class features. A spellburst savant must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they&apos;re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared consuming a spell slot of the appropriate level, assuming she hasn&apos;t yet used up her spell slots per day for that level.\n\nTo prepare or cast a spell, the spellburst savant must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&apos;s level. The saving throw DC against an spellburst savant&apos;s spell is 10 + the spell&apos;s level + the spellburst savant&apos;s Wisdom modifier.\n\nA spellburst savant can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-2: Spellburst Savant Spells in {i}Spellburst Savant: Revised{/i} under &quot;Spells per Day.&quot; In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score.\n\nA spellburst savant may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. At 1st level, she can prepare four 0-level spells and one 1st-level spell each day. At each new spellburst savant level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1-2: Spellburst Savant Spells in {i}Spellburst Savant: Revised{/i}. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells a spellburst savant can prepare each day is not affected by her Wisdom score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster instead affect the number of spells a spellburst savant can prepare.\n\nA spellburst savant must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour meditating. While meditating, the spellburst savant decides what spells to prepare and refreshes her available spell slots for the day. If she wishes, she can choose to partially prepare her spells like a wizard can, leaving slots unfilled to fill later. A spellburst savant can prepare spells from her entire spell list; she does not have a spellbook.\n\nLike a sorcerer, a spellburst savant can choose to apply any metamagic feats she knows to a prepared spell as she casts it, with the same increase in casting time (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats in the {i}Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook{/i}). However, she may also prepare a spell with any metamagic feats she knows and cast it without increasing casting time like a wizard. She cannot combine these options—a spell prepared with metamagic feats cannot be further modified with another metamagic feat at the time of casting (except with her nova spell class feature).\n\nIf the spellburst savant casts a spell (including spells she&apos;s learned with her extracurricular study class feature) that has an effect determined by its caster&apos;s Intelligence or Charisma, she may instead use her Wisdom." compset="ClSpecial" summary="You cast spells and can substitute Wisdom for Intelligence or Charisma">

She can reuse the excess energy of her spells in the form of abilities called fundamentals.\n\nWhenever the spellburst savant casts a spellburst savant spell (including a cantrip, such as {i}detect magic{/i}), she charges her body with fundamentals associated with that spell of her choice. At 1st level, a spellburst savant can be charged with up to 1 fundamental at once; this increases to 2 fundamentals at 5th level, 3 fundamentals at 10th level, 4 fundamentals at 15th level, and 5 fundamentals at 20th level. If a spellburst savant casts a spell while she is already charged with a fundamental, she can replace one or more fundamentals she has active with any that are associated with the spell. Fundamentals are supernatural abilities, not spells, and as such, activating them does not provoke attacks of opportunity, they do not have any sort of components, and they are not affected by spell resistance.\n\nA spellburst savant stays charged with fundamentals for 1 minute after casting a spell. If she casts another spellburst savant spell, it extends the duration that she is charged with each fundamental to 1 minute from that moment. The power of her current fundamentals is determined by the level of the last spell she cast (not including Heighten Spell or similar effects). The spellburst savant can activate a fundamental she is currently charged with as a standard action. Starting at 5th level, she can activate one as a swift action, as well. This allows her to use two different fundamentals in a given round (or the same one twice), if she wishes.\n\nThere are six fundamentals, and each is associated with a particular type of spell.

  <thing id="cSbSNovSpe" name="Nova Spell" description="Once per round, a spellburst savant can cast a spell as a &quot;nova.&quot; By incorporating a massive burst of unseen energy at just the right time, she can modify her spell as she sees fit. When she casts a nova spell, she can spontaneously apply any metamagic feats she possesses with a total level adjustment of +0 to the spell without increasing its casting time or changing the spell slot needed to cast the spell. This is in addition to any existing metamagic effects on the spell, though she cannot spontaneously apply metamagic feats in excess of those allowed by this ability at the same time (metamagic rods, however, may still be used in conjunction with this class feature).\n\nAt 3rd level and every two class levels thereafter, the number of levels worth of metamagic feats that the spellburst savant can apply to her nova spells increases by 1. For example, a 3rd-level spellburst savant could apply Extend Spell (+1 adjustment) to her nova spells, and a 13th-level spellburst savant could potentially apply Empower Spell (+2 adjustment) and Quicken Spell (+4 adjustment) simultaneously. Some abilities reference the maximum level worth of metamagic the spellburst savant can use with her nova spell; this number is called her nova spell rank.\n\nWhen Heighten Spell is used with this ability, the spellburst savant chooses how many levels she will use it to adjust her spell by, then treats her spell as that many levels higher. The Dazing Spell feat cannot be used on a nova spell (even by preparing it on the spell beforehand or with a metamagic rod).\n\nIf the spellburst savant uses Echoing Spell or another metamagic feat that allows her to cast the spell again, the result is the spell by itself, without the additional metamagic effects from this ability. Likewise, if she uses Familiar Spell or a metamagic feat that grants the spell to another, it does not carry the additional metamagic effects from this ability. In either case, the resultant spell cannot itself be cast as a nova spell.\n\nIf the spellburst savant has an ability that reduces the cost of a metamagic feat (such as the Magical Lineage trait), when used with a nova spell, it reduces the total adjustment, if applicable. For example, a 3rd-level spellburst savant with Magical Lineage ({i}burning hands{/i}) could apply Empower Spell (normally a +2 metamagic feat) to that spell, because its adjustment is reduced by 1.\n\nSome spellburst savant class features allow her to make additional adjustments to her nova spells by making similar adjustments to metamagic feats. These abilities note their level costs in their descriptions.\n\nFinally, nova spells have a unique interaction with a spellburst savant&apos;s fundamental effects. Whenever a spellburst savant casts a spell as a nova spell, she can apply the metamagic effects and class features she used with the spell to the next fundamental she activates, if applicable. For the purposes of determining what feats can be applied and how they work, treat a fundamental as if it were a spell with the descriptors of any damage types it deals and a level equal to the level of the spell the fundamental was charged with. Any metamagic feats that do not apply to a given fundamental are ignored, and the spellburst savant only gains this benefit from the last nova spell she cast (if she casts another nova spell, it overrides the current set of effects if she had not used them yet).\n\n{b}Nova Spells and Items:{/b} Some items (such as a {i}spell-storing weapon{/i} or {i}ring of spell storing{/i}) allow a character to store spells within an item for later use. When such an item is used to store a nova spell, it does not keep the effects the spellburst savant added to her spell.\n\nLikewise, a spellburst savant cannot craft items of nova spells, nor can she use her nova spell ability with an item (except with the spellburst scholar&apos;s nova channel class feature)." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Add metamagic for free to one spell per round">

When she uses this ability on a magic item, she chooses a single 1st-level spell that was required to create that item and adds it to her spellburst savant spell list (regardless of its original list or type), allowing her to prepare it normally, activate spell trigger and spell completion items, and the like. She can only have one spell added to her list in this way at any one time, and she must have the item on her person to cast the spell she added with it. If she loses the item or wishes to add a different spell, she can cut her tie to the item and repeat this process with a new item. The spellburst savant may also use this ability to study a spellbook or similar magical writing, learning a spell so long as she has the pages it was written on with her.\n\nAt 6th level, a spellburst savant can learn another spell with this ability of up to 2nd level, with the same process and restrictions as the first. At 10th level, she can learn a third spell, this one of up to 3rd level. At 14th level, she can learn a fourth spell, this one of up to 4th level, and at 18th level, a fifth spell of up to 5th level.\n\nSpells learned with this ability are prepared and cast at the level of the spell the spellburst savant memorized, with the same components (except divine focus components, which she ignores), though she may still use her various class features to modify them freely. A spellburst savant can learn a spell that is already on her spell list using this ability; if she does, she learns a new &quot;version&quot; of the spell, identical to the one she studied.\n\n{B}Extracurricular Spell Levels:{/b} When a spellburst savant uses the extracurricular study class feature to learn a spell, the level of the spell learned is determined by the item or magical writing&apos;s creator. For example, studying an item that incorporated a {i}lesser restoration{/i} spell created by a paladin would grant the spellburst savant that spell as a 1st-level spell.\n\nIf the creator of the item is unknown, the GM is encouraged to decide what level the spells in the item are, and these numbers should be given to the player of the spellburst savant when they identify the item&apos;s properties in some way. Alternate-level spells might be given as unique treasure for a spellburst savant, and some spellburst savants may even actively search for unique spells to learn.\n\nIn the complete absence of a spell level (such as when an item was crafted by ignoring spell prerequisites), the spells are presumed to be the sorcerer/wizard versions. If the spell does not appear on the sorcerer/wizard spell list, then default to the lowest level it appears on any 9-level caster spell list, then the lowest level it appears on any 6-level spell lists, then 4-level spell lists.\n\nA spellburst savant starting at a level higher than 1st should be allowed to begin play having purchased items crafted by spellcasters of their choice." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Add a 1st-level spell to your spell list">

Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be wielded. If a spellburst savant attempts to cast a spell without her bonded object worn or in hand, she must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.\n\nA bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the spellburst savant has on her spell list and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the spellburst savant, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the spellburst savant’s level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.\n\nA spellburst savant can add additional magic abilities to her bonded object as if she has the required item creation feats and if she meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a spellburst savant with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the spellburst savant who owns it. If a bonded object&apos;s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.\n\nIf a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the spellburst savant prepares her spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per spellburst savant level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in 3 this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item.\n\nA spellburst savant can designate an existing magic item as her bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.\n\n{b}Note{/b}: If your bonded object does not have any other powers or properties yet, there are power-less versions of the wand, staff, ring, and amulet available on the magic tab." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Gain an object you use to cast spells">

Using this ability does not require an action, and can even be done against spells that she doesn&apos;t see the origin of, so long as she has the chance to attempt to identify it. She can likewise mimic spells she finds in items using her extracurricular study class feature. Determine the levels of these spells as normal for that ability.\n\nMemorizing spells in this way is taxing to the magpie mage, and as such, she can only have a limited number of spells memorized at once with this ability. However, she can freely lose memorized spells to replace them with new ones as they come up.\n\nOne a spell is memorized, the magpie mage can cast it using her spellburst savant spell slots. In effect, her memorized spells are an additional set of &quot;spells known&quot; from which she can draw. They are cast as arcane spells.\n\nSpells memorized with this ability are cast at a level identical to that of the spell she memorized, with the same components (except divine focus components), though she may still use her various class features to modify them freely. If the spell she observed and memorized had a metamagic feat applied to it, she applies that metamagic feat to it as well and casts it as such, even if she doesn&apos;t have that feat (though she cannot cast it in any other way if this is the only way she knows the spell).\n\nAt 1st level, a magpie mage may begin play with a single 1st-level spell memorized from any spell list. A magpie mage created at a level above 1st can fill her slots for memorized spells from the lists of any 9-level spellcasting class (such as the cleric, psychic, or wizard), up to the maximum level of spells she can cast, and any spells drawn from any items she begins play with.

If she succeeds at her save, she can immediately cast that effect herself, making decisions and choosing new targets as appropriate. She does not expend a spell slot when using this ability.

This functions similarly to a spellbook, except that it does not begin with any spells in it.\n\nBy spending 8 hours experimenting with his magic and writing down the results, the spellburst scholar can create a special page imbued with his magic. This page is infused with a bond similar to that between the scholar and his extracurricular spells, except that other spellcasters can access it, if they know how. The spellburst scholar can have a number of these pages in creation at once equal to his class level + his Wisdom modifier.\n\nWhen the spellburst scholar uses this ability to fill a page in his notebook, he chooses a single spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that he can cast as a spellburst scholar to write into the book. He can modify the spell with his deconstruct components, deconstruct energy, deconstruct intention, and deconstruct effect class features freely (he must have those class features to modify the spell), as well as metamagic feats.\n\nThe spell is written into his notebook as a sorcerer/wizard spell with a level equal to the spell&apos;s original level plus a number based on the modifications (if any) the spellburst scholar applied with his class features. He cannot apply effects that reduce metamagic costs (such as the Magical Lineage trait) to spells written in a spell notebook.\n\n• {i}Deconstruct Components:{/i} +0.\n\n• {i}Deconstruct Energy:{/i} +0 if the energy type was changed to acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic; +1 if the energy type was changed to negative or positive energy; +1 if the energy was changed to typeless.

The spellburst scholar and other mages who learn or prepare spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list can prepare or cast this spell so long as they have the page or a copy of it on hand during their spell preparation (for prepared spellcasters) or when they cast it (for spontaneous spellcasters).\n\nThis spell can be written into scrolls or made into other magic items such as wands, and wizards and similar spellcasters can copy this spell into their spellbooks if they have access to the page. However, if the page is ever erased or destroyed (something that the spellburst scholar can do as a free action, regardless of the page&apos;s location), any magic items and spellbook pages incorporating it lose the ability to access the spell.

If he copies it into his own spell notebook, he strips it of the protections and ownership it previously had, replacing them with his own magic. As such, a spellburst scholar can copy a spell page without any risk of it being destroyed later by the original writer of the spell.\n\n{b}Note: New spells can be created in the Hero Lab editor to represent these customized spells.{/b}" compset="ClSpecial" summary="Combine Spellburst Savant effects and metamagic to make new spells">

  <thing id="cSbSShoSta" name="Shooting Star Cartridges" description="A gun witch has the ability to fill her guns with magic, conjuring elemental bullets. As a free action, she can expend her nova spell ability for the round to gain the following benefits:\n\n• As a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the gun witch can load her firearms with motes of energy similar to those created by the starspray fundamental. This does not require a free hand, and reloads all of her wielded guns to full capacity simultaneously. When she does so, she creates bullets and propellant out of raw magical energy, rather than loading with normal bullets (though she may still gain the other benefits of this ability with real bullets, if she wishes). If the gun witch possesses the Rapid Reload feat, she can instead do this as a free action.\n\n• The gun witch&apos;s firearms cannot misfire.\n\n• The gun witch deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage with her firearms, rather than the damage type the attacks would normally deal. She chooses the element of an attack as she makes the attack.\n\nStarting at 4th level, when a gun witch activates this ability, she can apply additional effects to her guns, based on the metamagic feats she possesses. The maximum total adjustment she can apply to this ability is equal to her nova spell rank. Not all metamagic feats are represented here; at the GM&apos;s option, a gun witch with a metamagic feat that is not on this list may apply the effect of a similar feat to her attacks. Dazing Spell may not be used with this ability, and unlike with a nova spell, effects that reduce metamagic adjustments do not apply to the feats when using this ability.\n\nSome of these effects are noted as Limited Use. Such effects can only be used once during the duration of this ability, and can be activated as a free action when the gun witch meets the conditions of the effect (such as by hitting with a particular type of attack) before the start of her next turn. A gun witch can apply a Limited Use effect multiple times when using this ability, counting its metamagic adjustment again and gaining the ability to use it an additional time before her next turn for each time she does so (but still only once per attack).\n\nOtherwise, the effects granted by this ability last until the start of the gun witch&apos;s next turn (at which point she may activate it again, if she wishes), and function only for guns she wields.\n\n• At the cost of a +1 metamagic adjustment, the gun witch gains a bonus on damage rolls with firearms equal to her Wisdom bonus (if any).\n\n• Aquatic Spell (+1): The gun witch&apos;s firearms can be fired underwater freely, and take no penalties for doing so.\n\n• Bouncing Spell (+1, Limited Use): When the gun witch misses with an attack with a firearm, she can immediately reroll that attack against a different target she can attack within range.\n\n• Catastrophic Spell (+6, Limited Use): The gun witch can charge a bullet with massive explosive energy. Instead of targeting a creature with the attack, she targets a point within her firearm&apos;s maximum range, then rolls a single attack roll and compares it to the ACs of all other creatures within 1,200 feet of that point (even creatures behind cover; treat this effect as a spread for these purposes). She does not take penalties for attacking at multiple range increments with this effect, nor does she suffer from miss chances. She uses the same damage roll for each creature hit with the explosion.\n\n• Concussive Spell (+2, Limited Use): When the gun witch hits with a firearm attack that deals sonic damage, she can inflict the penalty from the Concussive Spell feat to the target for 1 round.\n\n• Consecrate Spell (+2): The gun witch automatically confirms critical hits with firearms against evil creatures and creatures with the evil subtype.\n\n• Disruptive Spell (+1, Limited Use): When the gun witch hits with a firearm attack, she can inflict the effects of the Disruptive Spell feat on the target for 1 round. The concentration check DC prompted by this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the gun witch&apos;s class level + the gun witch&apos;s Wisdom modifier + the level of the spell being cast.\n\n• Ectoplasmic Spell (+1): The gun witch&apos;s firearms are treated as having the {i}ghost touch{/i} weapon special ability.\n\n• Empower Spell (+2): When making a full attack this round, the gun witch can make one extra attack with a firearm at her full base attack bonus. This does not stack with haste and similar effects.\n\n• Enlarge Spell (+1): The gun witch halves the penalties for making firearm attacks at more than one range increment.\n\n• Fearsome Spell (+2, Limited Use): When the gun witch hits with a firearm attack, the target becomes shaken for 1 round (no save). This effect does not stack with itself or other fear effects to create a stronger fear condition.\n\n• Flaring Spell (+1): When the gun witch hits a creature with a bullet that deals electricity or fire damage, that creature becomes dazzled for 1 minute.\n\n• Heighten Spell (+X): The gun witch gains a +X bonus on attack rolls with firearms.\n\n• Invocation of Society (+0): Half the damage the gun witch deals with firearms is City damage. This effect can only be used within a settlement of Small Town size or larger.\n\n• Maximize Spell (+3): The gun witch automatically confirms critical hits with firearms.\n\n• Merciful Spell (+0): The gun witch&apos;s firearm attacks deal nonlethal damage (including any additional damage they might gain from other abilities).\n\n• Persistent Spell (+2, Limited Use): When the gun witch&apos;s otherwise successful firearm attack is negated by an ability, it instead hits the target normally. This effect can only bypass one ability per attack (such as the Smash from the Air feat or a martial counter), and only functions if the attack would have otherwise hit.\n\n• Reach Spell (+1/2/3): The gun witch treats her firearm targets as being 1, 2, or 3 (depending on the metamagic adjustment used) range increments closer for the purposes of determining the penalty from range increments (but not for determining whether or not an attack is made against touch AC).\n\n• Rime Spell (+1, Limited Use): When the gun witch hits with a firearm attack that deals cold damage, can cause the target to become entangled for 1 round.\n\n• Scarring Spell (+1, Limited Use): When the gun witch hits with a firearm attack, she can choose to deal no damage and instead inflict the penalties of the Scarring Spell feat to the target.\n\n• Seeking Spell (+2): The gun witch&apos;s firearms are treated as having the seeking weapon special ability.\n\n• Sickening Spell (+2, Limited Use): When the gun witch hits with a firearm attack, the target becomes sickened for 1 round (no save).\n\n• Silent Spell (+1): The gun witch&apos;s firearm attacks make no noise.\n\n• Snuffing Spell (+2, Limited Use): When the gun witch hits with a firearm attack, she snuffs out all non -magical light sources carried by the target.\n\n• Thundering Spell (+1, Limited Use): When the gun witch hits with a firearm attack that deals sonic damage, she can cause the target to become deafened for 1 round.\n\n• Toppling Spell (+1, Limited Use): When the gun witch hits with a firearm attack, she can make a trip attempt against the target as if she had damaged them with a Toppling Spell." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Load and enhance your gun with magic">
