Fix spelling errors:
PFRPG_Bestiary_Variants.user:-Changed the boostrap thingid.raMummSwC to use thingid.raS2SwamCr so we don't have to have the Campaign Setting#3.
PFRPG_Racial_Monk.user:The Stunning Fist feat needs to be boostraped serpeately but this handles the equivalent monk level.</comment>

Add a widget to fix poison:
Any character with the Poison Use class ability can purchase and use poisons. For now, they are the only classes that have a list of ?always available poisons? (those noted below)?no other class may purchase poisons unless they appear on a chronicle sheet. Alchemists, ninja, and poisoner rogues may only purchase the following poisons from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook:
Giant wasp poison
Large scorpion venom
Medium spider venom
Shadow essence
Small centipede poison

new code method
foreach bootstrap in this
May be much faster

Exalted of the Society is limited in Society to Cleric, since the one from Shattered Star is not legal in Society.

Make use of another race without replacing it.

This grants you a +2 profane bonus to one ability score of your choice that lasts for 1 year from the date of this Chronicle sheet. Denote the selected ability score below.\n\nIngesting a sigil wafer is an evil act that shifts your alignment one step toward evil unless you receive the benefits of an atonement spell. If such an alignment shift would result in an evil alignment, you may no longer play the character in the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign.\n\nALL:  #4-10: Feast of Sigils (7-11)\nNote: Mark Moreland said on Jan 27, 2013 &quot;you could still be good (after paying for an atonement while being unable to remove the cursed item or simply not choosing to remove it because you like the reward) and not have to keep paying for atonements.&quot;\n\nFull Item Description:\nA sigil wafer must be created in a special ritual involving seven participants. Their blood is combined and painted onto wafers, and in the process a fragment of each participant&apos;s soul becomes bound into a wafer. Anyone whose soul fragment gets bound into a wafer takes 2 points of ability drain divided as he chooses between one or two of his ability scores. If a participant in the ritual consumes the sigil wafer containing the fragment of his soul, he recovers this ability drain immediately.\nIf instead someone other than the person whose soul is inside the wafer consumes it, she gains a +2 profane bonus to an ability score of her choice for 1 year. A character can benefit from only one bonus from a sigil wafer at a given time. The person whose soul fragment was in that wafer loses that part of his soul permanently, so consuming a wafer in this way is an evil act. The one consuming the wafer shifts her alignment one step toward evil. Players who do so should be given the opportunity to atone for such actions before the scenario&apos;s conclusion if such an alignment shift would result in their removal from the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign.\nA sigil wafer crumbles to dust if the creature whose soul it contains a fragment of dies. A sigil wafer can also be destroyed in a manner that returns its soul fragment to the rightful host (and heals his ability drain). The sigil wafer must be soaked in holy water until it dissolves." compset="Wondrous">

While it orbits its owner&apos;s head, that owner gains a bonus feat. This can be any feat she meets the prerequisites for.\n\nThe ocher rhomboid ioun stone radiates an evil aura at all times, and anyone who wears it (that is, causes it to orbit her head) is considered to have committed an evil act. The alignment of the one wearing the stone shifts one step toward evil. Players who wear the stone should be given the opportunity to atone for this action before the scenario&apos;s conclusion if such an alignment shift would result in their removal from the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign.\n\nThis ioun stone is cursed, and can&apos;t be removed by its owner or anyone else except by the methods outlined on page 536 of the Core Rulebook.\n\nAs with other ioun stones, the ocher rhomboid has a resonant power when placed inside a wayfinder. First, it turns the wayfinder into a cursed item that can only be removed in the way the stone itself can. Second, the wearer gains Knowledge (arcana) as a class skill for as long as she wears the wayfinder.\n\n{b}Requirements{/b}: Craft Wondrous Item, caster must be 12th level; {b}Cost{/b} 15,000 gp\n\nALL: #4-12: The Refuge of Time (7-11)\nActivating during the game is at no cost and you gain the item and curse.\n\nNote: Mark Moreland said on Jan 27, 2013 &quot;you could still be good (after paying for an atonement while being unable to remove the cursed item or simply not choosing to remove it because you like the reward) and not have to keep paying for atonements.&quot;" compset="Wondrous">
