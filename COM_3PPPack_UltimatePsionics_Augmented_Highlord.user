  <thing id="cPUHighlord" name="Highlord" description="{i}&quot;My will is the guiding light of the battlefield.&quot;{/i}\n—Alva Sunblade, a highlord\n\nThere are those who are meant to serve, and those who are meant to rule. A highlord stands proudly as one of the latter, joining minds together in a powerful network driven by his will and goals above all else. His true power shows itself when fighting alongside his allies, but if deprived of followers, the highlord can still fight by invading the minds of his enemies and briefly bending them to his will.\n\nUnlike other telepaths, a highlord&apos;s power runs far deeper into both his mind and those of others. For a highlord, the touching of minds is a two-way streetjust as he draws on the minds of his subjects, they get a glimpse into his thoughts and desires. The strong connection of a highlord&apos;s collective allows him to avail himself to the talents of both his allies and any enemies unfortunate enough to fall under his sway. When a highlord speaks, others obey. What a highlord decrees becomes fact, manipulating the course of battles, whether they take place in the mind or outside of it.\n\nEach highlord chooses his own path, using the tenets they follow as a guideline to further their own goals. A highlord can drive his soldiers to seek victory at any cost, or exploit them for temporary advantages in combat. Those with evil in their hearts may treat their allies like pieces in the game of battle to be sacrificed if necessary. However, benevolent highlords may value the lives of those under his command, and consider them as friends or assets too valuable to discard. Instead, such highlords choose to use their talents to guide their allies towards a mutual goal. A highlord can drive his collective to step over the bodies of their fallen comrades, or to work together and persevere as one.\n\n{b}Role:{/b} The highlord is a battlefield leader who guides the minds of his allies and grasps the minds of his enemies. By forcing enemies into his collective, he can inconvenience or incapacitate them, or direct his allies with pinpoint precision. Through his psionic abilities, he can fight alone or strengthen his party, ruling the battlefield regardless of his choice in tenets.\n\n{b}Alignment:{/b} Any. Though certain alignments may gravitate toward different tenets, any given individual may channel the tenets of a highlord towards whichever goals they desire." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

At 4th level and every three levels afterwards, a highlord learns an additional highlord decree.\n\nIn order to use a decree, the highlord must expend his psionic focus. He cannot regain that psionic focus until the decree ends (either by its duration running out or the highlord dismissing it).\n\nWhen a decree&apos;s duration runs its course, the highlord recovers the psionic focus he spent to use the decree. In any round after the one he activated the decree in, the highlord can dismiss its effect as a move action, regaining the psionic focus he expended to use it. If the highlord possesses the Psionic Meditation feat, he can instead dismiss decrees as swift actions. A highlord who has multiple psionic focuses (such as through the Psicrystal Containment feat) can have multiple active decrees at once—one for each psionic focus.\n\nUnless specifically noted, decrees are mind-affecting effects, and if a member of the highlord&apos;s collective is unwilling to be affected by one of his decrees (such as if it applies a negative condition, or directs them to take actions they&apos;re unwilling to take), the collective member can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the highlord&apos;s class level + the highlord&apos;s Charisma modifier) to resist the effect of the decree. This means that they forgo any actions that may have been granted and they ignore any benefits or conditions that may have been applied. A creature willing to be affected by a decree can voluntarily accept it; if they do, it ignores any immunity to mind-affecting effects they might possess. A highlord can take the Ability Focus (decrees) feat, in which case it affects the DC of saving throws made against any of the decrees the highlord uses." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Gain a variety of collective-based psionic abilities">

The highlord can establish a location as his territory, after spending at least a week in the area around it. This location must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is a number of feet per side equal to 10 feet per highlord level. If it is a public (or at least well known) area, it becomes widely regarded by others that the highlord controls or own it in some way. The highlord&apos;s power influences the appearance of the area through his open heart ability, though objects within it are not changed as to become unrecognizable.\n\nIf another creature is already considered the controller or owner of the area, that creature and the highlord make opposed Charisma checks. The character who succeeds in this check is considered the owner or controller of the area the highlord designates, though the original owner is free to contest this claim by confronting the highlord directly. After establishing an area as his territory, the highlord must return to it at least once every three days to renew his claim upon it. Otherwise, the effect disappears and other creatures may become considered the owner or controller of the area, as normal.\n\nThe highlord can also channel this power into one of his subjects. As a full-round action, the highlord can designate a willing member of his collective to bear his mark. As a result, that creature remains within the collective and can communicate with the highlord through telepathy, even if they were to leave the collective&apos;s normal range. As long as the creature is designated by the highlord&apos;s mark, the highlord can communicate through that creature and use Charisma-based skills as if he were occupying that creature&apos;s space, using his skill ranks and bonuses in place of the marked creature.\n\nThese marks can be dismissed as a free action. The highlord can only mark a single location or creature at a time. Affecting a location or a creature with his mark means he is unable to use this ability until he dismisses the first mark.\n\nAt 8th level, the highlord can maintain a mark on both a location and a creature at the same time. His followers also grow more vigilant in their defense of the highlord&apos;s territory.

In addition, the highlord can use his powers and class abilities from creatures that he has marked, treating the range and effects of such effects as if he were the marked creature. Doing this requires the highlord and the creature he has marked to use the same action required to manifest the power or use the ability.\n\nAt 18th level, the highlord can maintain a number of marks equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1) at the same time. These marks can be on any combination of locations and creatures." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Mark your territory or minion for various benefits">
