      September 9, 2012 - Tim Shadow
      -Fixed "Devil, Drowning" as it appears the spell "spHydrTor2" was incorrect or actually attached to some other official data set then the APG.  I changed it to "spHydrTor3" which is the correct level and things started to compile again.
      -Removed the Sources from all the "Racial Specials" by hvaing them marked to a specific AP it prevents other Editiors from resusing the work for a different AP.
      -Added the "Product ID" to some of the racial specials that where missing it.]]></info_history>

  <thing id="rauPuppetM" name="Puppetmaster" description="As a full-round action, an incutilis can drive its lesser tendrils into any helpless Small or Medium creature it occupies the same square as, and pump the victim full of poison and chemicals. The victim is killed instantly and becomes a zombielike creature under the incutilis's control. This zombie is not treated as being undead, and is immune to spells and effects that only affect undead (like damage from positive energy). The incutilis is attached to this zombie-typically by the head-occupying the same square and moving along with it. The incutilis can make attacks with its tentacles independently of the zombie's slam. It can also retract its tendrils as a move action, but doing so causes the zombie to collapse and revert to a normal corpse. The incutilis must retract its tendrils before it can move away from a zombie it's attached to. Any attack that deals damage to the zombie also deals 1 point of damage to the incutilis, regardless of how much damage is dealt to the zombie, while area-affecting spells affect both the puppeteer and zombie. A character can attempt to attack just the incutilis, but takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Killing the incutilis destroys the zombie." compset="RaceSpec" summary="Turns Small or Medium creature into a zombie it physically controls.">

  <thing id="ruKelpWrat" name="Kelpie&apos;s Wrath" description="Besmara's herald is Kelpie's Wrath, a haunted ship that is a living being. It looks like a storm-battered pirate vessel with the skull and spine of some great sea creature mounted on the prow, with eerie lights flickering on its deck and streaming from its masts. The ship is the source of many horror tales of abandoned ships found in the ocean or spectral ships crewed by ghosts, but it is actually an independent creature with a malign, vengeful intelligence. On the rare occasions when it comes to the mortal seas at Besmara's bidding, it usually does so to punish some buccaneer for a horrid blasphemy against the Pirate Queen. Far more often it is left to its own devices, sailing mortal waters, the Ethereal or Astral Planes, or strange dreamrealms in search of plunder, danger, and glory.\n\nThe ship's origins are mysterious and legends about it are contradictory. In some stories it was originally the flagship of a notorious pirate king who swore to forever serve Besmara, and when he finally died she merged his spirit with his ship so he could continue his service. Other tales tell of a demon-tainted kelpie that grew to a monstrous size and was kept as a beloved pet by the goddess like a mad dog until it was slain by adventurers and resurrected in this form to continue its predations. Still others speak of a devout priest-captain of Besmara who swore to bed no other woman so he could service the goddess in the afterlife, but then fell in love with a girl in a coastal village; according to this tale, the goddess cursed the priest to always roam the sea and never touch land so he would always pine for the love he could not have. The ship does not answer queries about its origin, and if pressed on the matter it has a habit of grabbing its interrogators, diving hundreds of feet under the water, and casually watching them gasp out the last of their air before it tears them limb from limb.\n\nThe ship is completely animate and needs no crew-it can tie and release its lines; raise, lower, and adjust its sails; open or close all of its doors; and so on. It moves about foreign objects (such as cargo) using telekinesis, and it sometimes does the same to its rare passengers, slamming doors on hands or throwing people overboard if it feels a lack of respect. Though it has a wheel and rudder, it resists mortal attempts to steer it as if it were a mundane ship- something it considers very disrespectful.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nKelpie's Wrath has no need to eat, drink, or even breathe. Because it can &#226;&#128;&#156;swim&#226;&#128;&#157; in any direction, including underwater, it may be found on the surface, cruising deep beneath the sea, or even skimming the bottom of the ocean. If facing an opponent it cannot easily defeat, it is likely to retreat deep underwater (assuming its foe cannot easily follow) or use teleport or plane shift to reach a safe place. It prods old wrecked ships for loot, storing its prizes within itself and only relinquishing its treasures when the goddess desires something it carries. Many loot caches on the sea floor actually belong to the ship, buried and marked in its memory for later counting.\n\nWhen called by mortals, it demands treasure as payment for its services, preferring chests full of gems and gold coins. It has a lecherous, voyeuristic streak, however, and has been known to lower its price if arrangements are made for mortals to perform carnal acts on its decks-while it telepathically murmurs approvingly. If properly bribed, it serves with grudging loyalty until the task is done, then leaves. It is best suited for tasks requiring the destruction or terrorizing of enemy ships or fleets, though it can easily transport dozens of people or tons of cargo anywhere in the world or even to another plane. It is also willing to serve as a lure or decoy, disguising itself as a slow, loot-rich merchant vessel or mysterious shipwreck in a cove.\n\nThe ship is fully mobile in waterlike environments on other planes, including the Ethereal and Astral Planes. It enjoys sailing the &quot;waters&quot;&#157; of the ethereal sea and raiding xill settlements, or changing through clusters of soul-predators in the Astral Plane. It also finds pleasure in the bizarre seascape of the Maelstrom and has ventured into watery parts of the Abyss, though it is always ready to plane shift if it suspects a trap or a shift in the terrain that would trap it.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nKelpie's Wrath sometimes follows Besmara's ship, the Seawraith, at a respectful distance on its travels through the planes, like a well-heeled dog afraid to attract too much attention to itself. When commanded by the goddess, it immediately complies, mixing a need for approval with an abject fear of punishment for any perceived disobedience. The ship acts like the only thing it cares about is the goddess, and is willing to sacrifice itself for her approval-it would swim through lava or acid, or run itself aground on a beach of adamantine spikes to please her.\n\nThough the ship has no need of crew, it sometimes offers to save drowning sailors in exchange for a number years of service. Those who accept vanish and are not seen again-unless the draugr it summons are actually the revenant forms of these rescued sailors. Whether these souls think half-life at the ship's beck and call is better than actual death is unknown, for they do not speak of it. Some pirate-priests believe the ship is searching for a soul great enough to take its place, becoming the new mind in charge of the living ship and freeing whatever controls it to live again or pass on to Pharasma's Boneyard." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ruCanopyCr" name="Canopy Creeper" description="A little-known menace of the jungles and forests of uncharted southern Garund, the canopy creeper is a semisentient plant that blends in with the foliage of the forest canopy and makes use of the flora's own outgrowth to trap and feed upon its prey. The canopy creeper resembles a mass of thickly knotted and twisted jungle vines that correspond to the colors and varieties of its native habitat. It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center mass, which also conceals a large, beaklike maw. The canopy creeper can spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak exposed.\n\nThe actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total. A canopy creeper can live for hundreds of years in a hospitable climate if sufficient sunlight and food sources are available.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nCanopy creepers are plants naturally evolved to take advantage of their surroundings. They grow amid the lush foliage of jungles or rain forests where a diverse array of vine plants proliferates. The canopy creeper climbs up among the tree tops and intertwines its own vine-grown body with those that grow naturally, enabling it to gain control over the naturally occurring network of vines to use as a source of both defense and sustenance. While a canopy creeper does gain food and energy from photosynthesis, it cannot maintain its active metabolism when relying only on the nutrients gleaned from sun and rain. For maximum efficiency, it uses the vine tendrils that it gains control of to detect by scent, to entrap, and to draw prey toward itself. It is also able to use these vine tendrils to procure food as they draw the nutrient-rich fluids from creatures entangled within their embrace, which are then conveyed back to the controlling canopy creeper.\n\nWhile the canopy creeper's primary method of attack is through its vine tendrils, it does have a large beak mouth composed of a hard, hornlike material. This beak is normally concealed within the center of its vine mass, but when creatures approach that prove able to resist its vine tendril attacks, the canopy creeper tries to draw them in close enough so that it can attack with its beak as well. It can consume prey with this mouth, but this is not its preferred method of feeding as most of the prey's fluids are lost as the beak tears the creature apart, resulting in fewer nutrients than if it were to feed solely through the vine tendrils.\n\nA canopy creeper naturally mimics the appearance and growth of the types of vines that grow in its environment, so when one is concealed among the vine-tangled foliage above, it is difficult for even an experienced outdoorsman to detect. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is usually hanging about 100 feet above the ground, making its appearance even more difficult to discern. Canopy creepers' preferred prey is Medium or larger creatures since these tend to hold more of the nutrient-rich fluids that the creepers feed upon; meanwhile, Small and smaller creatures&#226;&#128;&#148;such as small monkeys&#226;&#128;&#148;can often be seen cavorting around and even suspended from a canopy creeper, oblivious to its presence. However, during starvation conditions when the creeper is forced to rely upon photosynthesis for its survival, it readily preys upon such smaller creatures as well. The result of this preference, however, is that the canopy creature typically focuses its attacks on opponents of at least Medium size.\n\nCanopy creepers store a great deal of moisture from their normally wet habitat in their vine structures, making them difficult to burn. However, this fact, as well as their adaptation to warm climates, makes them particularly susceptible to cold attacks, which cause them to become brittle and prone to fractures in their vine structures.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nA canopy creeper out of its habitat is a canopy creeper in serious trouble. The creature relies on the prolific presence of other vine growths to camouflage its presence and to provide an aerial habitat from which it can feed safely above most creatures that might prey upon it. As a result, if a canopy creeper is caught on the ground away from screening foliage, it flies into a berserk frenzy, lashing out with its beak as it attempts to make for the nearest tree or high ground to escape.\n\nA well-fed canopy creeper buds once every 4 or 5 years and drops dozens of small seedlings to the ground. Most of these shrivel up and die from lack of sustenance, but one or two usually manage to survive on rats and other vermin until they grow large and strong enough to become mobile, a process that usually takes about a month. These seedlings then instinctively begin looking for a new hunting area away from their parents and siblings, since the plants are naturally solitary and avoid encroaching on each other's hunting territory. A successful seedling reaches full size in 2-3 years if it finds a location with suitable prey to feed upon. During the time when the plants are seedlings, opportunistic horticulturists have been known to contain and transport canopy creepers, transplanting them elsewhere and raising them as potent guardian plant creatures." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruSeaCat" name="Sea Cat" description="The feral sea cat (sometimes referred to as the sea lion, sea tiger, or sea leopard) is among the most vicious and ubiquitous of coastal predators in the world's tropical oceans. The upper body of a sea cat is that of a typical large cat-be it a lion, tiger, leopard, or cheetah-complete with a pair of clawed paws capable of rending the flesh from its prey. In place of back legs, however, the sea cat has a sleek and powerful tail that allows it to move quickly and silently through the water. While only the back half of a sea cat looks fishlike, its entire body from the neck down is covered in fine scales and fins, making it a formidable swimmer. Among individual sea cats, these scales vary greatly in color and pattern, often influenced by the primary habitat of a given specimen; most sea cats, however, have bright coloration in striped or spotted patterns. The typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs upward of 800 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nUnlike many aquatic animals, sea cats can survive in both fresh and salt water and in any subarctic climate, though they prefer warm seas to temperate lakes or rivers. Sea cats rely on speed and ferocity in the hunt, and are thus not built to withstand extreme cold, as they lacks fur or fat to insulate them in frigid waters. Most sea cats live in the ocean, where the diversity of life allows for a varied and consistent supply of food, though prides of sea cats and particularly adventurous individuals of the species have been known to follow prey into river deltas and beyond to inland lakes if pickings become slim in the sea.\n\nA sea cat's diet consists of small fish, crustaceans, and aquatic mammals such as seals and otters, but the creature's overpowering predatory and territorial instincts often lead it to attack ocean birds, humanoids, and even other aquatic predators such as sharks and crocodiles. Coastal fishermen in areas where sea cats are known to dwell vigilantly look out for the predators, because the beasts have learned that netted or hooked prey is easier to kill and steal from the line, using less energy. As if the theft of a hard-earned catch weren't enough to keep anglers on guard, a sea cat that finds itself unsated by a net of fish or a trapped crab will often turn its sights on the other end of the fishing line and attack the very fisherman who helped it gain its meal.\n\nWhen not hunting, sea cats can be found on coastal rocks, coral islands, or even isolated beaches sunning themselves and digesting their most recent meals. When in a state of rest, sea cats are typically less alert and more vulnerable, and thus often lounge in pairs or larger groups so that one can act as lookout. This is especially true of mothers rearing cubs, which have been known to stay awake for as long as a week straight to allow their young rest in their most vulnerable time of life.\n\nSea cats are ferocious hunters and when taken by the primal urge to fight, do so to the death, with little regard for anything but their prey. Whether hunting or protecting its territory, a sea cat generally attacks immediately upon discovering a target, even when faced with a much larger or more dangerous foe. A sea cat uses its claws and bite frantically, only ceasing its assault when the target is dead. If faced with multiple opponents, a sea cat attacks the nearest target and single-mindedly fights until that creature is dead. Pairs or prides of sea cats use pack tactics when hunting or defending their territories, wearing opponents down until a single beast can dispatch it, often allowing those of the larger group to escape while the entire pack focuses on a single target.\n\nA sea cat's physical characteristics are as much a product of the animal's environment as they are a result of genetics, and a sea cat's coloration often directly mimics its habitat. Sea cats living among colorful coral or particularly vibrant vegetation are often marked with spots and stripes of vivid red, orange, violet, and yellow, while those specimens on rocky or sandy beaches take on more earthy tones and mottled patterns.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSea cats are born in litters of between one and six cubs, and mothers raise their young in isolation from the rest of a pride until the young are between 6 and 9 months in age. During this time, the mother teaches the young to hunt, mark their territory, and defend themselves against intruders. When a litter of sea cats reaches maturity, their sea cat mother simply abandons them and returns to her pride, leaving the young to fend for themselves. Some young find their way back to the pride and are quickly assimilated into the group, while others form new prides centered around the location where their mothers abandoned them.\n\nA pride typically consists of a single male (called a bull) and as many as a dozen mature females who do a majority of the hunting and defending of the territory. Males without a pride of their own remain solitary hunters and are called stags. Each year, at mating season, stags approach a pride's territory and attempt to lure females away from the rest of the group as the females keep vigil over the pride's territory. When a male has a single female isolated, the two battle with all the ferocity of their species. Whichever sea cat has the upper hand relents in the last moment before killing its foe as a sign of acceptance of the mating offer, and if the other sea cat remains peaceful and does not use the moment of hesitation as an opportunity for counterstrike, the courtship dance is considered a success.\n\nOccasionally, a particularly willful stag encroaches on a bull's territory in an attempt to wrest his pride from him. In these cases, all females abandon the males to their duel, returning the following day and taking up loyalty to whichever male remains alive. The typical pride changes leaders once or twice a year, while more volatile prides see a change in leadership as often as five or six times annually.\n\nA sea cat's territory generally extends between 2 and 5 miles from its den, though most sea cats patrol only as far as a mile or two from the shore. Since a sea cat can't breathe water and must come up for air, only the bravest or most foolhardy sea cats venture farther than 2 miles from land, meaning a creature wishing to bypass a sea cat's territory can often go around it by traveling farther out to sea than the cat itself is willing to swim to protect its realm. A sea cat releases a powerful pheromone into the water to mark the boundaries of its territory, and thus must trace the borders every day or two in order to maintain them, as the constant flow of water dilutes the scent to the point of ineffectuality within 4 days depending on the strength of currents and tidal and weather conditions.\n\nThe sea cat's generally low intelligence and high level of ferocity makes it incredibly difficult to train or domesticate, but merfolk, aquatic elves, locathahs, and even surface-dwelling pirates and sailors have occasionally been known to take a cub and raise it as a pet. Whether these are simply legends meant to frighten away potential enemies or true accounts of taming a sea cat are not widely known, but the sea cat's natural territorial instincts make it a formidable guardian if properly trained. Additionally, some pirate ports are known for capturing sea cats and pitting them against one another for sport." compset="Race">

Others claim the ancient people sacrificed entire villages of souls to a powerful, bloodthirsty deity in exchange for the tiberoliths' protective technology. Most scholars, however, believe the Ghol-Gan spent centuries building tiberoliths to serve as the guardians of their most treasured assets. It still remains unclear, however, why these mighty defenders have survived while their creators did not.\n\nThough quite rare, tiberoliths have been the focus of much obsession among those few who know of their existence, primarily because of the enigmas that continue to surround them. Some who live near one of the ancient colossi believe the blue fluid flowing within an activated tiberolith acts as a panacea, or is otherwise a magical agent. However, those seekers lucky enough to have defeated one of the guardians invariably find themselves disappointed. Far from mystical, the fluid exhibits no magic whatsoever, and is as caustic as any acid, burning through flesh as easily as through fabric. Given the combination of both acid and electricity inside the tiberoliths, some alchemists have posited that the tiberoliths are powered by enormous techno-magical batteries. Perhaps more terrifying is the thought that the tiberoliths might actually be batteries, meant to be gathered together for some great magical undertaking, in which case the greatest treasure a tiberolith guards may be the tiberolith itself.\n\nFor some industrious adventurers, especially those of an arcane or alchemical bent, a tiberolith represents an opportunity to cultivate a powerful, forgotten technology-yet such experimentation rarely succeeds, more often resulting in the pulverized or acid-eaten corpse of the would-be scholar. While tiberoliths' limbs all bear hollows securing puzzlebox-like devices, modern scholars have yet to determine the exact nature of the apparatuses, and how they relate to the constructs' operation. Based on reports of tiberoliths' unpredictability in battle, both historical and recent, it seems the Ghol-Gan never quite perfected the technology, either.\n\nOver the years, adventurers traversing former Ghol-Gan strongholds have recorded numerous sightings of these rare creations. Tiberoliths do not patrol their homelands, however. When undisturbed, they resemble frightful statues resting in ruined cities, standing outside crumbling ziggurats, or breaking the canopy of thick jungles. It's only when uninvited humanoids venture past that these hulking statues come to life, oblivious to the fact that those they once served have long since vanished from this world.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nTiberoliths are typically found alone among Ghol-Gan ruins, particularly those located in the Isles of the Shackles. It's said tiberoliths are most numerous on islands such as the horrifying Cannibal Isles, the eerie Devil's Arches, the haunted Yoha's Graveyard, and the intrepid Ushinawa Isles, despite the efforts of the latter's samurai inhabitants to eradicate the behemoths.\n\nOn rare occasions, tiberoliths are found slumbering in squads of three or four, usually positioned to protect the ruined entrances of their lost creators' most sacred structures. Whether alone or in groups, many tiberoliths have been inactive so long they've become obscured by overgrowth or claimed by rising sea levels. They might nearly blend in with the environment, but the sound tiberoliths make when activated-a high-pitched whirring not unlike the shriek of an eagle-is unmistakable.\n\nAlthough tiberoliths are generally considered unintelligent servants of their vanished masters, an ancient legend speaks of an uncharted island in the Shackles where tiberoliths appear to have gained some measure of sentience. This tale states that, within the hollow of an inactive volcano, a terrifying number of whirring tiberoliths go through the motions of the most heinous Ghol-Gan rituals in a ghostly tribute to their lost masters. However, because of the story's dubious origins-and the sheer unlikeliness of its claims-most people regard this as little more than a fireside tale.\n\n{b}Construction{/b}\nConstruction A tiberolith is created from three to four slabs of naturally occurring stone such as limestone, typically weighing 2,000 to 2,500 pounds each. These slabs must be bound with vegetative- or sinew-based lashing materials treated with rare unguents costing at least 7,000 gp.\n\nThe processes by which tiberoliths are created are exceptionally rare, and most of the secrets to doing so were lost with the fall of Ghol-Gan. Certain explorers, scholars, and magic-users from the Shackles might possess these secrets and be willing to share them, but they could cost upward of 10,000 gp.\n\n{b}Tiberolith{/b}\nCL 12th; Price 48,000 gp\nCONSTRUCTION\nRequirements Craft Construct, acid fog, limited wish, stone shape, creator must be at least caster level 11th; Skill Craft (sculptures) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 18; Cost 24,000 gp" compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruComozWyr" name="Comozant Wyrd" description="A comozant wyrd appears to be approximately 3 feet of heatless blue or violet plasma jutting from solid, protruding objects (usually a mast or spar of a ship). It flickers like flame, and its only static features resemble those of a humanoid face. Manifested on the Material Plane, the creature emits an uncanny buzzing, hissing noise, but does not consume creatures or objects it touches. Creatures adjacent to it or to targets of its illuminating flames often find their hair literally standing on end and their bodies crawling with harmless but unnerving sparks.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nComozant wyrds are most often encountered in the hearts of Golarion's greatest storms, particularly the Eye of Abendego and the smaller storms it spawns. They are incredibly rare, and almost always solitary; no sightings on land have ever been reported.\n\nBecause they are so rare and their natural environment makes detached study improbable, few creatures on Golarion even know of comozant wyrds, let alone understand their nature. Citing their command of storms, some speculate that the wyrds are infant forms of an unknown breed of storm elementals, but others say they are fey spirits, born in the moment they appear and existing only for the brief time they shine.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nComozant wyrds have no society as such. Seafarers regard them with considerable awe for the danger and mystery that attend them, but few are brave enough to attempt conversation with living plasma on a wooden ship, especially mid-tempest. Displaying such mettle is a sure way to earn considerable respect from any ordinary sailor-persuading a wyrd to abate its storm could inspire outright awe.\n\nComozant wyrds rarely speak even to those fluent in Auran, preferring to communicate in a more primal way, using their illuminating flames. Those who have &#147;conversed&#148; with a wyrd in this way describe an alien mode of communication that is as much raw emotion and image as it is concept and word, and a mysterious mixture of knowledge and ignorance. For instance, when first encountered, a wyrd apparently does not understand how different from itself mortals are, or how dangerous storms are to mortal creatures. Overlying everything is an unsettlingly alien but somehow childlike inquisitiveness, mixed with rage or fear if the wyrd feels threatened.\n\nThe form this interest takes can vary widely. One report describes spending half an hour in communion with a wyrd, exchanging detailed mental images of elemental and humanoid creatures' anatomies and behaviors while the storm raged unheeded around them. Another speaks of a wyrd chasing the entire crew of a pirate schooner around the deck of the ship with electrical attacks, punishing those who slowed, and stopping only when half the crew was dead. A third author writes of being flooded with comprehension of the nature of the cosmos in a single ecstatic instant, only for the wyrd to banish its own storm and disappear.\n\nSuch vanishing is a reasonably common occurrence in non-hostile encounters with comozant wyrds. Several accounts agree that once wyrds understand the peril in which storms place mortals, they use their command of the weather to end the storm, even though this apparently forces them to either leave or vanish altogether. To some, this suggests that comozant wyrds possess at least some respect for life, and that what seems like cruelty may simply be uncomprehending curiosity, even playfulness. Naturally, those who have suffered at a wyrd's whim are unsympathetic to this view.\n\nOne of the few things almost all accounts agree on is that the touch of a comozant wyrd's illuminating flames seems to confer sudden insight. Judging by images glimpsed in wyrds' minds, they appear to know, but not always understand, things that they glimpse in the thoughts, pasts, and entanglements of those with whom they converse. On one occasion, this has led to a traveler learning that one of her companions was in the pay of a hated rival. Other authors recount glimpses of scenes relevant to them that were happening at that precise moment halfway around the world, scenes of which nobody on board could possibly be aware. One way or another, very few of the available reports fail to mention the author glimpsing a secret she could not otherwise learn, an answer-or at least a hint-to a puzzle she had been attempting to solve, or a flash of inspiration that enabled her to complete some great work. These tales lead some desperate souls to seek out storms to sail into, hoping for answers they can find nowhere else.\n\nComozant wyrds themselves do not seem to have a discernible agenda from moment to moment, or indeed to place very much weight on past experience. They will attack-or, conversely, stop fighting and &#147;parley&#148;- without hesitation, based purely on whether they feel their immediate situation warrants it. This is not to say that they forget past behavior, but they seem to bear few grudges. They react badly when they detect deception, however, seemingly regarding it as only a short step down from outright violence." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruShipSent" name="Ship Sentinel" description=" Ship sentinels are animated constructs that are bound to a specific vessel and to that ship's captain. Crafted to resemble a humanoid figurehead, a ship sentinel normally rests at the prow of its ship, granting good fortune and protection to the crew. But in times of dire need, the captain can also activate the ship sentinel, causing it to spring to life and fight alongside the vessel's crew. Although individual features of ship sentinels may vary, all ship sentinels are made of wood and have the same general statistics.\n\nA ship sentinel stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nA ship sentinel's form is carved and shaped by skilled woodworkers, but cannot truly be brought to &quot;life&quot;&#157; without offerings from the sea. Most spellcasters who endeavor to create these guardians crush a mixture of sand, shells, and valuable pearls and mix it with saltwater and oils, creating a grainy varnish. The carved figure is coated with the solution and then brought to the shores of the sea and affixed to the bowsprit of the craft it will protect. Only then is the construct's creation finally complete. Unlike with most constructs, however, control of the creature does not fall to the creator, but rather to the captain of the ship to which it is affixed. If the captain of the ship changes, control of the construct passes to the new captain.\n\nAlthough resistant to most hazards of sea and storm, all ship sentinels eventually wear down after a time and require polishing, cleaning, and recoating with the specially prepared varnish used during the construct's creation. If maintained in this fashion, however, a single ship sentinel can guard a ship-passing from captain to captain-for decades or even centuries.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nShip sentinels are solitary creations, and a single construct is capable of defending even the largest of ships. Their presence is an undisputed boon to all aboard-though most captains prefer not to speak of their crafts' guardians, preferring to keep the constructs as secret weapons. When the sentinel is needed, the captain must shout a word or short phrase to bring the construct to life. An awakened ship sentinel is able to recognize loyal members of its crew, placing them under its protective wards, and directs its attacks against any living targets that it does not ward, though the construct's master can point it toward specific targets.\n\nIn combat, ship sentinels can pulverize flesh and bone with their heavy wooden hands, but normally wield a weapon of some kind-usually a spear, rapier, shortsword, or other light weapon. Stories even exist of elven vessels that armed their ship sentinels with huge bows, or of daring Brevic sea captains who gave their constructs the fabled Aldori dueling swords of their homeland. Regardless of these variations, most weapons used in a ship sentinel's construction draw upon the construct's inherent nimbleness, an agility belied by the figurehead's wooden form. But whether their weapons are forged or natural, all ship sentinels can infuse the sting of seawater and salt air into their blows, wracking their foes with crippling pain.\n\nShip sentinels are resilient foes, their wooden bodies capable of turning aside most attacks that cannot pierce or gouge them. Unfortunately their construction also makes them vulnerable to fire-their greatest weakness-and any magical fire quickly dries a ship sentinel's body to a nearly immobile brittleness.\n\n{b}Construction{/b}\nA ship sentinel is built from 400 pounds of wood. The creator or a hired artisan must then shape the creature into the desired likeness, usually after a fashion common to the nautical vessels of the region. Afterward, a special varnish is made from a mixture of sand, seawater, crushed pearls and shells, and magically treated oils-the varnish is worth a total of 250 gp and is applied to the entire form. If the creator intends for the ship sentinel to wield a weapon, a masterwork or better version of that weapon must also be supplied.\n\nCL 9th; Price 21,250 gp; 21,750 gp (ballista marksman); 23,250 gp (mariner's muse); 25,250 gp (sea sorcerer)\nRequirements Craft Construct, animate object, limited wish, creator must be caster level 9th; Craft (woodworking) check DC 25; Cost 10,750 gp; 11,000 gp (ballista marksman); 11,750 gp (mariner's muse); 12,750 gp (sea sorcerer)" compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruZombVoid" name="Zombie, Voidstick" description=" The voidstick zombie is the hateful creation of wicked shamans and necromancers, who use voidsticks to animate the dead. One voidstick is required for every Hit Die possessed by the base creature. These vile devices, each of which is 6 to 10 inches in length, are pierced through the living or dead body of a creature, pumping the dark energy of the void into its form. Packed with the bitter entropy of negative energy, the creature rises, seeking out the life force of others with endless sadness and insane determination. Its single goal is to extinguish life and smother any source of positive energy. Multiple voidsticks in a creature's form feed one another, augmenting their standard abilities and imbuing the touch of the voidstick zombie with the power to drain life from anything it touches. The zombie becomes almost a sliver of the void itself, existing in a state of such negative power that its very proximity can tamper with other creatures' abilities to summon the powers of the Positive Energy Plane, and with the perpetual sadness that numbs its own intellect it gains the power to enhance and influence other creatures that depend on negative energy.\n\nThese sad creatures, wracked with soulless negative energy, constantly hunger for destruction, delighted at every chance they get to snuff the spark of life from the living. They hunt the islands throughout the Shackles, especially the Cannibal Isles, where their creation began long before its current inhabitants made their home there.\n\nAs the brutal and savage kuru people of the Cannibal Isles explored the ruins of Ghol-Gan, they discovered the foul magic involved with the voidsticks, and as they turned to barbarism and cannibalism, their shamans carved these devices and created the first voidstick zombie seen on Golarion in thousands of years. The kuru use voidstick zombies for war against each other and to serve as ruthless hunters, culling humanoids who wander too close to their blood-drenched islands. Kuru shamans create the vile voidsticks in order to enhance their own necromantic strength as well as to animate voidstick zombies. In some tribes it is seen as a great honor to be transformed into one of these powerful creatures, and some aged shamans on the eve of their death elect to undergo this transformation instead of becoming a ritual meal for their tribes.\n\nSince the rediscovery of voidsticks, those interested in necromancy and the creation of new undead have sent emissaries to the Shackles eager to buy them. These enterprising necromancers experiment with the devices and unleash voidstick zombies into Avistan and Garund to fulfill their murderous intent." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruCoralCap" name="Coral Capuchin" description="Coral capuchins, when encountered outside of the water, look like a wizard's practical joke-they have the body of a small monkey, slick pink skin, a fishlike head, and membranous appendages that are a cross between a bat's wings and a fish's fins. They possess a monkey's innate intelligence and curiosity, displaying little fear of humanoids, but are also compulsive pickpockets that love the glimmer of gold and jewels, and posses the manual dexterity to relieve unsuspecting sailors and dockworkers of their hard-earned pay. An adult coral capuchin is a foot and a half in length, with a foot-long tail, a 4-foot wingspan, and a weight of 25 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nSages believe coral capuchins evolved from highly adaptive creatures living in the world's oceans. It is believed these creatures first developed as wholly aquatic creatures much like fish, and lived among brightly colored coral reefs where they used a form of camouflage to hide and escape predation, much like a cuttlefish or octopus. The creatures developed multiple methods of locomotion through evolution, and these biological changes allowed these creatures to crawl from the sea and walk on land. Eventually their fins transformed into wings, granting the creature greater mobility, and the ability not only to breathe the air above the waves, but also to soar through it.\n\nCoral capuchins are capable of surviving out of the water in their air-breathing form for part of the day, although they quickly deteriorate and die if they do not keep their bodies moist. They spend most of their lives below the waves, subsisting on small fish and all manner of vegetation, but often venture onto land to find a particularly tasty morsel, or to satisfy their overactive natural curiosity. They also love to fly and can often be seen circling the crow's nests of ships entering and leaving harbor. On land, they hunt small rodents, pick nuts and berries, and find the eggs of birds a particular delicacy. Coral capuchins also display an intense interest in the food and belongings of all manner of humanoid species. They are especially drawn to small, shiny objects, and can be counted on to abscond with anything interesting that is not nailed down. Coral capuchins' hands allow them to manipulate objects, but they cannot wield weapons.\n\nA coral capuchin is born as a wholly aquatic creature. Young coral capuchins lack the ability to fly or leave the water until they reach adulthood after approximately their first year of life. They are an incredibly fecund race, and females can produce a clutch of up to 100 eggs three times a year, though local aquatic predators usually devour most of these.\n\nBecause of their dependence on returning to the water, some coral capuchins venturing too far inland risk stranding themselves. Explorers find the creatures sickly and weak, sprawled out on the jungle floor covered in biting ants or picked apart by predators as they lie there dying. Coral capuchins that die on land dry, out to a husk that often turns to dust leaving only its brittle bones behind.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nLiving in greater numbers along the southeastern coast of Garund, these creatures have slowly spread out, making their way north and east over the last few centuries. A large colony of the creatures resides off the coast south of Sargava and within the Lower Korir River Delta. The canopies of the Jungle of Hungry Trees and the jungles of the Kaava Lands ring with the calls of coral capuchins. An infestation of the clever creatures has recently plagued the port city of Senghor on the Fever Sea, and a city authority has begun offering a bounty on the creatures in an attempt to reduce their numbers. A few colonies of the creatures exist farther north, with some making their homes in the warmer waters of the Inner Sea, while other curious tribes of these mischievous creatures inhabit the warm waters of the Obari Ocean on Garund's western coast.\n\nCoral capuchins live in tropical coastal areas, generally in small familial groups of fewer than 30 adults led by an older female. The first part of their name refers not only to their pinkish skin color, but also to their preferred nesting place-the coral reefs off of Garund's coast, where they make their homes in the countless caves and crevices found therein. They populate these vivid reefs to lay their eggs and hide among the protective growth, adapting their skin pigmentation to blend in.\n\nWholly unafraid of most humanoid species, coral capuchins are often domesticated by sailors and fisherman willing to put up with the creatures' incurable curiosity and penchant for petty larceny. They are often trained to fish for their masters, and are particularly sought after by those who make their living bringing up treasures from the ocean floor. Because of their love for shiny objects, they make excellent pearl divers, although it can sometimes be a struggle to get them to part with their treasures. Their voracious, omnivorous appetites also make them popular on long ocean voyages, as they are happy to reduce ships' endemic rat populations. Perhaps because of this, many sailors see them as good-luck mascots, although they are most popular with pirates, smugglers, and other such seafaring folk, who more willingly accept their thieving nature." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruKapre" name="Kapre" description="Vehement defenders of unusual natural locations, kapres have a complicated relationship with the &#147;civilized&#148; races. Formed of dense tree matter, they are as much part of the forest as their botanical brethren. Their intimidating physical size, territorial nature, and unusual approach to friendship often bring them into conflict with tribesmen and aggressive explorers. Furthermore, misleading myths paint them as vicious wife-stealers, violent demons, and even bringers of riches to those who can trap them. In truth, these arboreal giants are only dangerous to those who threaten the environs under their protection.\n\nWith slender limbs and thick, gnarled torsos made of twisted trunks and boughs, kapres are awkwardly humanoid in appearance, but have such rich personalities that those lucky enough call them &#147;friend&#148; see them as more people than plants. Festooned with hanging vines or seasonal blossoms, kapres blend in perfectly with the surrounding forest. Were it not for the soft glow of their eyes, they could be mistaken for treants.\n\nExceedingly secretive and wary, kapres prefer to avoid conflict where possible, using their imposing size and confounding auras to intimidate would-be invaders. Leaning out of huge trees, they blow smoke onto lost explorers, persuading them to flee from the locations the kapre protects. Even in peaceful discussions, they rarely drop their auras, aware that the most honeyed tongue can hide the cruelest intent. If things turn sour, they deal out fast and serious damage with their great wooden fists, and if their domain is breached, they fight to the death to turn invaders away. Though kapres are fearsome when their ire is raised, they are careful (and reasonable) enough to allow retreating aggressors to escape.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nMuch of the mystery that surrounds kapres is their own doing. Although shy, they enjoy the company of other humanoids and sometimes fixate on a particular creature, often a human female. This obsession manifests as playful teasing, using their confounding auras to befuddle the objects of their affections or keep others from visiting the women. Creatures that have a tolerance for trickery can become firm friends with the tree giants, earning protection, advice, and even romance. However, those who misunderstand these complex behaviors or those close to the &#147;victim&#148; can sour the reputation of kapres by reacting with jealousy and rage and branding kapres as dangerous or scheming. Rumors that capturing a kapre will force it to grant wishes were almost certainly started by a jealous chieftain whose wife caught a kapre's eye.\n\nThese mixed reactions have kept kapres cautious and encouraged them to develop methods of identifying and escaping traps. Their caution keeps them always ready to leap over a trip wire, snare, or spiked pit. They know their own terrain inside out, and constantly keep an ear to the ground, using their speak with plants ability to stay on top of any changes for many miles around.\n\n{b}Habitat{/b}\nEach kapre chooses a location sacred or important to it, which it then defends with its life. The reasons for choosing a particular location might make little sense to other creatures, and when pressed a kapre usually gives a cryptic or evasive explanation. This has proved frustrating for many would-be road builders or bush farmers who cannot quite understand why a half-acre of swamp should be of interest to anyone. Furthermore, the location a kapre chooses to defend is not always where it resides, and invading a kapre's home is almost as dangerous as sullying a sacred place. It is not uncommon for a careful explorer who has given a kapre's sacred spot a wide berth to end up the target of the creature's fury when the new route runs directly through the clearing the creature calls home. A kapre's home is usually easy to identify, and resembles a druid's grove: a clearing, carefully and sensitively pruned, with a single massive tree at its center.\n\n{b}Kapres Cigars{/b}\nKapres roll thick cigars, using a recipe so secret (and so potent) that neither tobacconist nor alchemist can identify the ingredients. Even in the chaos of combat their enormous cigars never fall from their mouths; their thick-skinned stogies interfere with their speech, lending a lazy drawl to their creaky voices" compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruTetrolim" name="Tetrolimulus" description="A terrifying mix of prehistoric arthropod and heavily armored mantis, the tetrolimulus is the stuff of nightmares for shipwrecked and abandoned mariners. Plated with a spiny crustacean exoskeleton, the upper body of the tetrolimulus is reminiscent of a very robust kind of mantis. Its raptorial forelimbs, folded as if in prayer, flash forward with frightening speed and precision to brutally slice opponents before they have had a chance to act. Captains and mutineers alike are quick to remind their enemies of these deadly claws and the creature's other name, the &#147;beach guillotine,&#148; for the brutal justice it exacts on those put ashore for choosing the wrong side in a mutiny.\n\nWith somewhat less panache, the tetrolimulus is often described as the &#147;sea-mantis&#148; because it resembles a crab's strong legs and shell merged with a mantis' powerful arms. Trailing behind is a scorpion's deadly stinger. The creature's durable, spiked shell covers five pairs of blade-like legs that work together to produce remarkable speeds even through challenging terrain. Truly a master of the beaches, the tetrolimulus has caught many mariners off guard with a blazing charge over varied terrain, perforating a noiseless trail through wet sand, then clattering over rocks with the sound of dice thrown across a table.\n\nIts final and most dangerous terror, held upright and waved like a regal scepter in combat, is the tetrolimulus's tail stinger. The stinger is razor sharp along its outer edge, but its neat incisions are nowhere near as dangerous as the poison that coats its blade. Those who succumb to a dose of poison-called tetrodotoxin-are soon to be a meal for the sea-mantis. Muscle spasms and cramps accompany a gradual slowing of movement, hinting at oncoming paralysis and the agony of a neat butchering while still alive for easy consumption. One of nature's cruelest poisons, tetrodotoxin is a popular tool of the Red Mantis assassins, who appreciate both the poison's painful efficacy and the mantis-form of its progenitor.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nOut of the water, the tetrolimulus adopts an unusual swaying movement of the upper body. Although its purpose is not entirely clear, it is thought that, much like the land-dwelling mantis, the movement enhances the creature's primitive vision and makes picking out prey by its own relative movement easier. It has been suggested that remaining completely still when confronted by a tetrolimulus may prevent detection, but none have been able to confirm the success of this tactic, and there are none who are confident enough of the theory to test it in the field.\n\nFemale tetrolimuluses, the hunters of the species, are by far the more aggressive. Rarely seen, males live in deeper waters as bottom feeders, emerging only in the mating season in early spring. At this time for a few days each year, both sexes make great journeys, sometimes of hundreds of miles, to return to ancient coastal breeding grounds. Here dominant and aggressive females meet and mate with the strongest of the smaller and more delicate males. Only a small number of these males get a chance to breed, and an even smaller number survive to return to the oceans. The energy and effort of their travels exhaust the females, and once they've been impregnated, the easiest and closest source of food is the weaker males surrounding them. A fertilized female may even continue to exhibit signs of availability to encourage more males to approach her-not for reproduction, but to satisfy her more immediate hunger.\n\nYoung are born at sea, and perhaps as payment for their strength and power later in life, they spend their first few months at the bottom of the food chain. Without the thick shells of maturity, they are easy prey, which contributes a great deal to population control of their species. As their shells thicken and harden, they start to enjoy a less harried existence, and by 6 months old they start to fight back. They reach maturity in 12 to 18 months and can live for up to 50 years.\n\nTetrolimuluses' behavior is largely instinct-driven, but during the breeding season the normally nomadic creatures will fight viciously to protect the shores of their ancestral breeding grounds. Even male sea-mantises rise to combat, though at sea they more commonly flee than risk confrontation.\n\nFemales can be found in the area of the Abendego Gulf, from Mediogalti Island all the way into the Shackles and as far north as the Sodden Lands. Even Rahadoum has seen the occasional tetrolimulus washed ashore to the south, where the creatures are feared as the twisted manifestations of Achaekek, conjured for worship by the Red Mantis and a stark reminder of the folly of religious devotion. There are descriptions of creatures similar to the tetrolimulus to the north, even into the Inner Sea, but these stories are as old and leaky as the ships of the pirates and traders who tell them and no reports of tetrolimuluses along the cost of Cheliax, for example, are younger than two generations.\n\nMuch of tetrolimuluses' bulk is armor, and despite their size they can survive on relatively small quantities of food. In perhaps the only mark of intelligence in their species, they try to avoid overfishing, instead roaming over several miles of coastline to balance their ecology. The majority of their diet is fish and cephalopods, but they are competent trackers and follow hints of habitation on their beaches to devour any coast-dwelling mammals foolish enough to find themselves on the beaches, including humanoids. Like most animals, tetrolimuluses tend to avoid large settlements or areas frequently visited by humans. Remote or inaccessible beaches are the females' preferred habitat, but occasionally a powerful storm rolling out of the Eye of Abendego can toss them on more popular or even populous coastlines. Surprisingly high concentrations of the creatures are found around Mediogalti Island and its outlying cluster. Some suggest this is due to deliberate cultivation by the Red Mantis, thanks to the tetrolimulus's favorable form, but it may simply be because the treacherous waters and hidden coves are perfect for their reclusive lifestyle, and the frequent mutinies, shipwrecks, and foolish adventurers provide a varied and ample diet for the brutal predators." compset="Race">

Some of the more enterprising residents of Ilizmagorti have developed a method of harvesting the cruel tetrodotoxin poison, from which the tetrolimulus gets its name, for sale to the assassins of the Red Mantis.\n\nA single dose of tetrodotoxin sells for 1,300 gp. Its rarity and potency make it a valuable product, and prices outside the Shackles or Mediogalti Island can be 50-100% higher.\n\nOne dose of poison can be harvested from the corpse of a tetrolimulus, provided the lower half of the creature is intact. This requires a DC 25 Survival check, and even those who usually find themselves competent at skinning or gutting creatures struggle with the intricacies of the sharp tail stinger.

Lacking any culture or society beyond what can be gained through physical might, these creatures are solitary hunters. Natural werecrocodiles usually stand taller and broader than an afflicted member of their species. In humanoid form, specimens often have a slight rigidity to their skin, a green tinge around their lips, or vertically slit pupils. The average male werecrocodile in human form stands 6 feet tall and has a powerful, muscular frame weighing up to 250 pounds, with females averaging slightly shorter and lighter.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nMost werecrocodiles prefer warm rivers, coastlines, and swamps-ideally within a day's travel of a humanoid community where they can stalk new victims. They favor fresh humanoid kills, but they also eat fish, small waterfowl, or anything else they can chase down and kill. Voracious predators, these creatures either kill and eat or otherwise drive away most other local, predatory species.\n\nWerecrocodiles delight in the power their forms give them over others and enjoy nothing more than terrorizing their prey before the kill. Such creatures often pose as river guides or experienced woodsmen in order to lead their chosen targets away from the safety of civilization. Once in the wild, a werecrocodile prefers to take the first opportunity it can to maim its victim before allowing the prey to escape. It then hunts the poor soul down, dragging it into the water and drowning it, then either devouring it or stashing the body in a mudbank for a later meal. Werecrocodiles often join groups of adventurers in hopes of just such opportunities. If its secret is discovered before the trap is sprung, a werecrocodile fights until the tide of battle turns against it, then flees to stalk its chosen victims from a distance.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nWhile werecrocodiles typically enjoy the solitude of their territories, small colonies of them can sometimes be found scattered throughout isolated swamplands. Most stories suggest that it takes a particularly strong and malicious werecrocodile to hold others of its kind in sway. Despite the believed preference for solitude, when these creatures do come upon each other, conflict is rare. As long as they heed one another's territorial boundaries, individuals hold an underlying tolerance of each other.\n\nHowever, when conflict does arise between werecrocodiles, such battles are typically to the death. Any dispute relating to territories or mates has only one rule: the victor may do as he wishes with his prize. This amuses any female being fought over, as even when a challenger defeats an opponent, if the female is unamused or unimpressed, she often simply kills the victor and feeds on his remains before going on her way.\n\nThe borders of werecrocodile hunting grounds are adorned with skulls slung together with varying forms of aquatic vegetation and hung from trees along or across waterways. These blatant displays serve a dual purpose: to warn away any potential encroachers and to evoke fear and anxiety in intelligent prey as soon as they enter the lycanthrope's territory. A werecrocodile's prowess correlates directly with the size and number of the skulls displayed on the borders of its territory.\n\nIn areas where werecrocodiles are know to lair, locals often treat strangers met alone in the wilderness with extreme distrust. In some communities, a wanderer that approaches without first displaying an object of silver worn against the skin is shunned, or attacked outright if he seems aggressive.\n\nBecause of their fascination with the power that their forms give them over lesser races, werecrocodiles rarely turn others into lycanthropes. Any afflicted werecrocodile was able enough to escape his hunter and survive whatever wounds he suffered. Afflicted werecrocodiles are often more malicious and cruel than their natural brothers, masking their self-loathing and despair with bloodsoaked acts of violence.

  <thing id="ruCycOracu" name="Cyclops, Oracular" description="A cyclops oracle retains more of the powers of foresight than most of its kin. In addition to a cyclops's typical flash of insight ability, an oracular cyclops can share its gift with others, granting them a boon on a future challenge. While often smaller than others of its kind, an oracular cyclops gains the ability to foresee danger coming its way. The statistics above depict a cyclops who is served by a cult of worshippers, and is therefore in good health. Other oracular cyclopes are sometimes kept as chained prisoners, at the mercy of their captors.\n\n{b}Cyclops Oracles{/b}\nThe practice of keeping a cyclops (sometimes in captivity) as a soothsayer began in Azlant, and continues to this day in parts of Avistan. Some cyclopes are treated as honored sages. For example, in living memory a cyclops oracle lived in a cave near Riddleport, and every year would predict the future of the town in exchange for a chest of silver and two dozen goats. Other oracles were slaves, forced to prophesy on demand. Many old castles have a special dungeon that looks out upon the surrounding countryside, where a cyclops was kept as both oracle and sentinel.\n\nThe race's power of foresight has diminished over the ages. The cyclopes of legend were said to see the future as plainly as a man sees the waking world, but ever since Earthfall their powers have weakened. The hundred years since the death of Aroden have marked an even sharper decline in their powers, leading some to wonder whether the loss of other prophecies and omens is somehow connected to whatever spiritual wound destroyed the cyclops empires of prehistory. Some say the cause of the Age of Lost Omens may be found in the ruins of legend." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruBakekuji" name="Bakekujira" description=" The seas of Golarion are home to many legends both living and undead, but the bakekujiras is perhaps one of the largest among these latter horrors. Some have trouble believing the old stories, but woe to anyone that discovers the truth. These embodiments of corrupted majesty prowl the seas, along with their flocks and schools of pestilent parasites.\n\nA bakekujira weighs about 50 tons, though sometimes less, depending on how long it has been decomposing. Bakekujiras are as large as they were in their former lives, measuring from 50 to 60 feet long.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThough the exact circumstances vary, the story of each bakekujira is similar: It was nothing more than an ordinary whale when whalers attacked. The whale managed to escape, but sustained a grievous wound from a whaler's harpoon. It died after days of anger and pain, only to arise as an undead monstrosity bent on taking revenge for its demise.\n\nAs a bakekujira goes about its new, corrupted existence, it continues to rot until all the flesh is stripped from its bones, leaving behind only an immense skeletal whale. The decomposition process draws all sorts of sea scavengers to the rotting whale, from gulls to fish. However, the flesh of a bakekujira is not only rotten-it is also toxic and deeply infused with negative energy. Any creature that eats of this flesh sickens and dies, only to rise shortly thereafter and continues its existence as an undead thrall inexplicably bound to the bakekujira. Normally these creatures take up residence in and around the putrefied body of the bakekujira, swarming throughout the creature and only emerging to push back any who would seek to do harm to their rotting host.\n\nThe bakekujira is relentless in its mission to upset and capsize any vessels reminding it of its descent into unlife, though because of the vastness of the sea, its quarry can be scarce. When a bakekujira does come across a ship, its rage is such that the beast cares little whether the vessel is an actual whaler or just a fishing sloop. The whale pits its full power against the ship, and is capable of capsizing all but the luckiest of ships with the most skilled captains. Bakekujiras are also able to affect the minds of the ships' crews. Their usual song is gentle, evoking thoughts of peaceful days in the sea. However, bakekujiras are able to channel their fury through their music, transferring to their victims the terror and helplessness the bakekujiras themselves experienced in their last moments of life. Using it jaws, tail, and enormous girth, a bakekujira attacks relentlessly until its angry spirit is laid to rest.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\n While there are stories about pods of bakekujiras collaborating to lay waste to fleets and port towns, it is unlikely that the massive undead beasts would even notice each other. They are creatures of destruction and see other creatures, even their own kind, as mere obstacles in their pursuit to wreak as much havoc as possible. This doesn't mean that multiple bakekujiras never attack the same target; rather, they simply attack independently, motivated by their own individual anger.\n\nOn rare occasions, large creatures such as giant vultures and dire sharks feed alongside the bakekujira's undead parasites. These creatures frequently succumb to these parasites and join the throng, swimming or flying alongside the bakekujira and taking a more active role than the whale's aura suggests. A GM can enhance encounters with bakekujiras by providing other undead creatures as auxiliary foes. Below is a list of appropriate animals typically encountered among a bakekujira's larger undead parasites, either with the skeleton or zombie template applied.\n\n\nAlbatross (use vulture stats), CR 1/2, HD 1\nEagle, CR 1/2, HD 1\nElectric eel, CR 2, HD2\nManta ray, CR 1, HD 3\nSeagull (use raven stats), CR 1/6, HD 1\nShark, CR 2, HD 4\nStingray, CR 1/2, HD 2\nVulture, giant, CR 4, HD 5" compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruGalvo" name="Galvo" description=" In a sunless trench in the Arcadian Ocean, deep siyokoy fleshcrafters created the first galvos to serve as soldiers in their war against the sahuagin and skum. Since those days, galvos have moved beyond their darkened trenches, breeding and expanding into shallower, warmer waters. In recent years, they have begun to come closer to civilizations, preying on coastal communities. A true horror to look upon, a galvo averages 7 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nDirect sunlight dries out a galvo's hide. This does not harm the galvo in the short term, but it causes discomfort. As a result, galvos prefer to stay deep underwater during the day and stalk the shadows by docks and riverbanks at night. A galvo can live both in the water and on land, and frightening stories tell of galvos springing up from the water to strike at prey both on ships and on beaches. While an electric eel's diet of invertebrates and f ish would easily sustain a galvo physically, it would not satisfy the sadistic creature's appetite for terror. Invertebrates and fish accept death too easily; galvos prefer prey that screams.\n\nGalvos do not wear armor or wield weapons. They attack with their natural weapons which are augmented with potent electrical charges. Much like the electric eels that form their bodies, galvos focus their energy into concentrated electricity, and discharge it with a touch. Even without their formidable electric powers, galvos are dangerous creatures. The eels that make up their bodies tear at their victims with biting mouths. To attack opponents outside their reach, galvos launch component eels from their swarming bodies.\n\nWhen a galvo kills a target, it feasts as soon as it safely can, usually after bringing the victim back to its underwater cave lair. The victim is stripped of any bulky metal armor and weapons, then subsumed into the galvo's writhing body, which peels apart and engulfs the corpse to swiftly and brutally devour its prey. A galvo discards the bones of its victims from its swarming body as they are picked clean. If the meal is small enough, a galvo can maintain its normal activities while it digests, chewing and tearing apart one meal as it hunts for another. Galvos defend themselves with a greater fervor when digesting, but do not attack as aggressively, as they are not usually in the habit of killing more than they can consume at one time.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThere is no true galvo society. Galvos sometimes work together, but these alliances often are short and last only through a single hunt and feeding. The strange creatures make exceptions during their two-month mating season, when spawned and fertilized eggs require additional protection in order to survive.\n\nDespite their propensity to work together during mating seasons, galvos do not actually require other galvos to reproduce. As galvos are composed of eels of both sexes, all eels forming a galvo are attracted to one another during these two months and the creatures appear more tightly wound, reducing their size slightly. Instead, the female component eels lay eggs within the swarm, which are inseminated by the male component eels. When the eggs hatch it appears as though a tiny swarm of eels simply emerges from the larger parent galvo, leading many observers to incorrectly assume galvos reproduce asexually.\n\nThere is no sexual interaction between separate galvos. They instead come together in cohabitation, working together to attack prey and feed. Typically each galvo births three to 10 infant tangles during this time. Adult galvo cohabitants care for the entire nest, not caring to keep track of which galvo birthed which tangle. As the mating season ends, the galvos find themselves less interested in one another. They drift apart towards the end of this hormonal phase, and each returns to its own lair. At this time, the infant tangles are expected to leave as well and fend for themselves. Only about half of all galvo infants survive to reach adulthood.\n\nWhen a galvo reaches adulthood, it claims a permanent lair. Ideal lairs are underground caves, although any large clearing between rocks and out of direct sunlight is satisfactory. A galvo primarily hunts the area near its lair, specifically the land above, where prey is plentiful and one catch makes a large enough meal to sustain it for several days.\n\nThe magically enhanced galvo hive mind develops a higher intellectual capacity than individual electric eels ever could, showing a level of intelligence approaching that of a below-average human. Galvos cannot speak, but they learn to understand languages when living among or near creatures that communicate verbally. If their need to cause harm is met and they are provided an aquatic living space, galvos sometimes even come to be loyal followers of more powerful creatures. This is especially true for siyokoys, who keep large stables of galvos at the ready in their endless fight against the sahuagin and skum.\n\nUnderwater, electric eels are irresistibly drawn to galvos out of a mix of familiarity and curiosity. Galvos, for their part, typically tolerate such followers for short periods of time before spurning the pests. There has never been a recorded case of a stray electric eel being absorbed into the swarm, although there have been many cases of galvos tiring of mundane eels' company and cannibalizing these followers.\n\nGalvos do not use items nor intentionally collect wealth. However, when they consume a victim, galvos indiscriminately eat its belongings during their hasty meal. Whatever gear on the corpse of a victim was too big to be eaten is expelled nearby, most often in the galvo's underwater lair. Reports tell of undigested gems and other valuables being found in the gutted component eels of a freshly killed galvo. In extremely rare circumstances, traditionally worn wondrous items (like a headband of inspired wisdom or a belt of mighty constitution) caught within component eels sometimes convey their magical effects to the galvo." compset="Race">

Its natural form is that of an huge scorpion, but it can also assume an armored humanoid shape suitable for stealth or interacting with Norgorber's followers. Though its main purpose for coming to Golarion is to kill, it has also been called to aid great thefts and bury terrible secrets.\n\nThe Stabbing Beast enjoys the company of mortals in the same way that a well-fed barn cat enjoys the company of mice. It sometimes &#147;plays&#148; with these toys, teaching them secrets of alchemy or assassination, though it just as often maims or kills them as it sees fit or according to Norgorber's greater plans.

It does not believe that anything other than its master can kill it, despite mortal records showing that it has been killed in the past; Norgorber wiped its memory of these failures when he resurrected his herald. Norgorber's herald is normally emotionless and cold, showing no remorse or regret for any death or injury. When the cult of Norgorber summons the Stabbing Beast, the mortals may present it with several choice targets to hunt and slay, though predicting its interests is difficult and the Beast may select its own target-or none at all-in exchange for its services. The Beast keeps trophies of its kills by covering the corpses in a preservative bile, swallowing them in its scorpion form, and regurgitating them when it returns to its lair deep beneath the planar metropolis of Axis.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThe herald of Norgorber lives only to serve his dark master, whose mandates may come to the Stabbing Beast in a steady stream of evil deeds or sporadically and with long periods of dormancy between. When idle for too long, it tends to turn off its mind and simply waits in stasis, completely inert like a clockwork device that has run down. It reacts to prayers to Norgorber as if they were echoes of its master's voice, drawing its attention without violence and bringing it to full alertness." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ruGigasCla" name="Gigas Clam" description="Commonly found only in shallow beds of sediment on the ocean floor, the gigas clam is an unusual foe-one that often catches divers and sailors unaware when they mistake it for merely an oversized mollusk. Shining, misshapen barnacles cover a gigas clam's tough and distinctive shell, glittering nodes that attract curious fish toward the beast's side. Even larger predator fish such as marlins, tuna, and sharks can find themselves in the tightly clasped jaws of a gigas clam.\n\nGigas clams are primarily sedentary monsters, content to lie in wait as prey inevitably wanders toward their seemingly harmless forms. Vast fields of the titanic bivalves can be found scattered along the ocean floor of the Inner Sea, feeding on fish and any debris that falls to the bottom, including shipwreck victims and castaways thrown overboard by pirates. If no food presents itself for some time, a bed of gigas clams either relocates or crawls toward land in search of a more dependable source of food.\n\nGigas clams depart from their mostly passive hunting style once per year, when the bulging summer moon is at its fullest. Entire beds of the creatures propel themselves upward and burst through the surface of the water, attacking passing ships as well as coastal communities. During these times, gigas clams seek out their most favored prey: air-breathing humanoids. Using their powerful siphons to slam into passing merchant vessels and war galleons, the massive clams are indiscriminate in their search for humanoid flesh. Though they are normally hasty and seldom use tactics to obtain their prey, occasionally a lone gigas clam uses its feminine figure to trick unsuspecting ships into gigas clam-infested waters. The clam and its kin ruthlessly ram the vessel until its contents spill into the open water.\n\nOnce trapped inside a gigas clam's quivering and contracting musculature, victims are almost certainly doomed, as the clam's acidic innards swiftly melt and destroy anything within. When engaged in melee, a gigas clam can strike with both its fleshy siphons as well as its terrible foot, which terminates in a toothy maw that can deliver devastating wounds.\n\nSince gigas clams openly attack land-dwellers only during 1 month out of the year, coastal communities and fisherfolk dwelling near gigas clam beds know to prepare their ships and docks for the deadly onslaughts of these creatures. But even the most formidable defenses are not enough to hold back great numbers of the clams, and most find it easier to simply avoid settling near gigas clam fields. Particularly bold monster hunters and sages travel throughout the Inner Sea during the summer in hopes of spotting the slimy beasts, using elaborate charts and maps listing past reports of the creatures to pick which areas to observe. A few whisper tales of immense magical pearls buried within the clams, which they postulate are responsible for the clams' increased size and intelligence. Others propose that the monsters absorb a portion of their victims' intelligence and memories while digesting them.\n\n{b}Infamous Deeds{/b}\nPrimarily encountered in the shallow depths of the Inner Sea and off the coast of western Garund, gigas clams leave a trail of destruction during their annual rampages, and have committed numerous deeds that prove them worthy of their notoriety.\n\nHumanoids living beneath the waves fear gigas clams as well-a field of the creatures destroyed the merfolk town of Selsurisa west of Absalom 10 years ago. The settlement had fought off the ravenous clams in years past, but the attack that devastated it was odd in that it took place during the region's cold season. The merfolk were thus unprepared when the beasts amassed and overran the town in a matter of hours. As the clams destroyed the town's sculpted caves and elegant spires, the merfolk sent waves of soldiers and giant crab companions to fight back, but their hasty defenses were no match for the sheer ferocity of the gigas clams. The merfolk have since relocated to other settlements around the Isle of Kortos, but have not forgotten the day of the attack, which many claim was inspired by fiendish sorcery not normally available to the gigas clams. Many of the merfolk still yearn to reclaim their overrun settlement, whose ruined towers and rubble-choked caves now serve as the breeding grounds for the brutal beings.\n\nIn the early days of Bloodcove's founding, gigas clams found their way deep into the Fever Sea and settled in the Vanji River delta, where they feed on the plentiful fish and other sea creatures that travel downstream with the river's current. The mammoth clams posed a great threat to the fledgling Bloodcove's fragile trade and commerce, since few ships dared sail near the shallow delta in fear of surprise attacks by the unpredictable creatures. The pirates of the then-small port banded together and eventually defeated the beasts, but were unable to kill all of them. Some residents still worry that the clams might organize a retributive assault." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruUgashIra" name="Ugash-Iram" description="South of Jalmeray, deep in the Yogisa Trench in the middle of the Obari Ocean, the terrifying gutaki known as Ugash-Iram lords over the underwater city of Achom. Ugash-Iram and its lesser kin practice foul rites and perform horrible rituals to honor their patron deity, Dagon, amid the city's strange and twisted spires, which rise out of a dark fissure in the seabed like claws climbing toward the surface. Crackling eruptions of magical energy briefly illuminate the city in flashes of light, but it is otherwise as dark and lightless as the souls of its foul inhabitants.\n\nBecause of its isolation in the deepest waters of the Obari Ocean, few surface-dwellers know of Ugash- Iram's existence, though those fisherfolk and sailors who've heard tales of the mighty being know to fear it. Locathah sages place the indomitable gutaki's age at over 3,000 years old, and dwellers in the underwater regions surrounding Achom have long loathed and feared Ugash-Iram, whose legions of devotees have spelled the ruin of countless aquatic cities. Ugash-Iram itself is responsible for destroying a dozen massive underwater cities in the past millennium, and the scattered ruins that lie around the Yogisa Trench serve as testament to its power.\n\nThose aquatic creatures Ugash-Iram doesn't outright annihilate are captured and integrated into Achom either as members of the slave caste or as converted devotees to Dagon. Entire tribes of sahuagin, adaros, and iku-tursos have united under the banner of Ugash-Iram and its gutaki kin in Achom, and the underwater metropolis bulges at the borders with the thousands of evil inhabitants who make their home there. These inhabitants raid for Ugash-Iram and populate its city, protecting Achom and performing all kinds of menial tasks for their overlord. With these minions, Ugash-Iram's deadly reach extends all the way to the surface of the Obari Ocean and even the nearby shores of Geb, Jalmeray, and Qadira.\n\nIsolated in its flooded metropolis beneath the sea, Ugash-Iram has plenty of resources, a generous life span, and thousands of minions at its disposal, making it a formidable foe for any who would seek to stop the despotic gutaki before its influence spreads even further.\n\n{b}Infamous Deeds{/b}\nThe legends of Ugash-Iram remain shrouded in mystery, since few aquatic humanoids have seen the monster, and fewer still have lived to tell the tale. Some claim that the gutaki gained its power by devouring other gutaki, gaining greater power and its array of 12 tentacles.\n\nOne especially strange tale claims Ugash-Iram once captured a great kraken and imprisoned it deep in the gaping Yogisa Trench. Ugash-Iram is said to keep the behemoth perpetually on the brink of death-the gutaki and its minions carefully torture the kraken and subject it to grotesque experiments and disfiguring transformations. Just as gutaki were supposedly born when Dagon defeated the great kraken Kaktora, Ugash-Iram hopes that by subjecting its captured kraken to cruel experiments, it can create its own race of 12-tentacled followers.\n\nWhile ships crossing the middle of the Obari Ocean face all manner of risks, perhaps the worst is capture by Ugash-Iram's minions. Records tell of a combined effort by Ugash-Iram's adaro and sahuagin soldiers to capture a diplomatic fleet from Vudra some years ago. A dozen lucky sailors perished during the raid; the aquatic horrors captured everyone else, smearing them with a magical jelly that allowed them to breathe underwater and dragging them to Achom for torture, experimentation, and eventual sacrifice to their lord Dagon." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ruAddu" name="Addu" description="As enigmatic as they are dangerous, addus hail from the most hellish corners of Golarion's deepest seas. Addu encounters are thankfully rare, but those who have faced one and survived tell tales of the beasts' unimaginable powers. As a result, merchant and pirate lookouts alike carefully watch the watery horizons for jagged, fiery-hued spines, which have come to signal seafarers' imminent doom.\n\nThe colors of the tropical deep-simmering reds, yellows, and oranges-decorate addus' long, serpentine bodies. In addition to the ominous fins on their backs, smaller spines jut from addus' snouts, heads, and necks. Their short but powerful forearms can strip flesh from bone, especially when the beasts employ them alongside their barge-sized jaws, which bear teeth the length of daggers. With long tails that can sweep from the water with whiplike velocity, addus can reach up to 50 feet long and weigh up to 14,000 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLegends claim that when Golarion was young, fissures in its deepest seafloors began spewing noxious gases left over from the planet's formation. These geysers helped provide life-giving heat to the equatorial oceans, but also rendered small pockets of deep-sea waters uninhabitable. Golarion's thriving aquatic ecosystem pushed back, however, and from these poisonous environs emerged the hardy addus. The geysers nurtured and strengthened these enormous, tropically colored creatures, instilling in them a mindless cruelty and a voracious hunger for raw meat.\n\nLegends maintain early addus trolled the edges of their toxic haunts, harnessing the power of rip currents to kill any prey lurking within the tolerable waters beyond. Eventually, addus evolved to embrace the poison native to their homes, and even to expel it as a weapon, bringing instant death to any creature unlucky enough to inhale it. Experts are unsure just how the addus developed their hunting techniques-whether magically or through a fluke of nature-but all agree that nothing known to modern scholarship explains their deadly abilities.\n\nIn time, the deep-sea creatures developed heightened instincts that kept them far away from the telltale haze of addus' watery lairs. It was then that hunger drove the beasts to establish hunting grounds in shallower waters. Their natural maliciousness led addus to fight among themselves until each survivor had enough space to roam and feed alone.\n\nScholars believe that every few weeks, addus experience a blinding hunger that prompts them to turn the seas red with the blood of their meals, which often consist of hundreds of pounds of raw, still-twitching meat. Addus are known to feed on whales, giant squid, dire sharks and-when other prey is scarce-sea serpents. Tales of epic battles between addus and sea serpents exist among many seafaring nations, scaring children and serving as a warning to sailors. Even more terrifying, however, are rumors that claim addus periodically crave humanoid flesh, and will capsize ships as large as their own bodies to obtain just a few bites of this succulent treat. Scholars debate whether addus hunt ships or rather attack them by mistake, confusing the vessels' shadows with those of surfacing whales. Regardless, addus pose a major threat to any vessel that frequents the vast stretches of open water where these beasts tend to stake their claims.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nOwing to their violent natures, addus are nearly always found alone. They are said to be most concentrated in Golarion's southern seas, where legends allege ancient, noxious underwater geysers once were plentiful. A particularly unsettling tale speaks of an area several hundred miles west of the Shackles archipelago where addus' hunting grounds perfectly abut one another like a deadly, invisible puzzle.\n\nAlthough an addu that intrudes on another's hunting grounds can most certainly expect to battle its fellow beast to the death, some pirate legends maintain that these creatures occasionally cooperate-when it suits them. For example, an Ollo-based pirate captain once claimed that after happening upon a vicious battle between two addus, his vessel came under attack when the beasts spotted his ship's sails. Once the pirates outran them, the addus turned on each other again, intent on settling their original quarrel. But given that survivors of addu attacks speak of the speed with which the creatures dispatch their targets, most old salts conclude the captain invented a compelling but ultimately fictitious tale. It's believed that no one has yet survived a battle involving more than one addu.\n\nScholars believe that female addus typically patrol hunting grounds measuring only a few square miles, while male members of the species are more nomadic, often moving on to new territories every few weeks. This may explain the beasts' reproductive practices. Aquatic elves report that up to five times during the creatures' fertile years, female addus deposit groups of six to eight eggs at the edge of their hunting grounds. The eggs secrete the noxious fumes that lend addus their infamy, attracting any nearby males, which then fertilize them. Addlets (as their young are called) appear to be born into a state of frenzy, immediately initiating brawls among their siblings. As is fitting for such vicious creatures, only the strongest addlet of a litter survives to seek its own hunting grounds and wreak havoc on its own victims.\n\nDespite their violent tendencies, addus appear to be long-lived creatures. Native tales speak of single addus that have terrorized the same waters for up to 6 centuries. These stories say the longer addus live, the more they crave humanoid flesh-or the more they crave maritime battle, depending on the variety of the tale. Either way, some of these stories describe addus, wizened through millennia of survival, capsizing ships before their unfortunate crew members ever realize they're being targeted. Then, the tales claim, the ancient addus pluck their victims from the sea, stripping the flesh from their bones one by one and offering no mercy save the final rest of death." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruDevDrown" name="Devil, Drowning" description="Few creatures among the hosts of Hell have as horrific a visage as a drowning devil-called a sarglagon in its own Infernal tongue. Four unblinking orange eyes stare out of its vaguely piscine head, flanked by a pair of curving ram's horns and located above a wide mouth of countless jagged teeth. Where one would expect hands or even claws, a drowning devil instead has fists of writhing, stinging tentacles, as though the infernal creature bore a pair of sea anemones as poisonous cudgels. A pair of finlike wings sprouts from the beast's shoulders, wafting like seaweed at their frayed ends. Below the waist, a drowning devil resembles a long, serpentine fish, with a fluked tail and a ridge of spines running down its back.\n\nDrowning devils take great pride in being the bestadapted guardians of Hell's waterways, and are among the few fiends who travel the seas and rivers of the multiverse as part of larger infernal plots. Though a drowning devil can function perfectly well on dry land or even in the air, it is truly a force to be reckoned with within its natural aquatic environment. In any environment, a drowning devil moves with a haunting litheness as though it were swimming through the air or across the ground.\n\nThe typical drowning devil weighs 600 pounds, and when stretched to full length, can surpass 15 feet from head to tail.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nMost sarglagons come into being when petitioners of Hell exhibit particular skill or passion for keeping secrets, guarding passageways, and protecting against incursions. Drowning devils are vigilant guardians whose versatility in all environments makes them ideal sentinels, especially over Hell's waterways. From the swamps of Stygia to the River Styx, intruders often use Hell's aqueous channels to encroach upon Hell's borders from other planes, and cowardly souls flee to these waterways in the hope of finding a route to escape their eternal torment. Thus, those lower-ranking devils who please the masters of Hell by guarding the secrets and captives that power the plane and its denizens are sometimes transformed into sarglagons, granting them better tools with which to ensure the safety and seclusion of their charges.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nFrom the fetid swamps of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell, rise the Academies of Lies, where the archdevil Geryon and his minions hoard secrets, lies, and valuable knowledge with which they can manipulate weaker souls throughout the planes, bringing untold numbers to the ranks of Hell. But while the osyluths actively seek these secrets and lies to swell their library-temples, drowning devils serve as the guardians of the mires that surround them, ensuring unwelcome eyes do not gaze upon the secrets that ensure Hell's dominance, and preventing oaths held tight by their masters from slipping out of the devils' grasps.\n\nDrowning devils not only serve as sentinels of Hell, but are often called by diabolists and conjurers on the Material Plane to serve as guardians of their infernal lairs, hidden treasures, or personal secrets. Gaining a sarglagon's service often comes at a high price, for a drowning devil is not likely to simply stand watch when given access to an item so valuable that it requires a fiendish guardian. Rather, the contracts required to bind them to their task typically come with strict terms defining how long the devil will serve as protector, what access it can have to that which it guards, and what portion of its charge it may claim when its service is finished.\n\nThose who wish to bind a drowning devil or call one as a planar ally find better success when the secret or treasured prize they wish the sarglagon to protect is more valuable, more damning, or ultimately more attractive to the devil, as the temptation of guarding something it can later use for its own benefit can motivate a drowning devil to bargain more flexibly, lest it risk losing access to such a prize for being too stubborn or demanding. Even then, mortals must be as vigilant as their devil servitors in order to ensure that the sarglagons are not exploiting some oversight in their negotiations.\n\nSome on the Material Plane find themselves the wards of drowning devils without personally entering into an agreement with a sarglagon. This is especially common in cases where the taint of infernal blood runs through a human's veins, or more often when a human births a tiefling child. In these instances, the devils related to the mortals contract the sarglagons to act as their proxies upon the Material Plane-agents tasked with ensuring the safety of the devils' humanoid kin. Whether the devil progenitors do this to keep their mortal offspring safe for their own far-reaching plans or out of some sense of loyalty depends on the particular instance, but for those under the care of a drowning devil, the motivations rarely matter. A sarglagon's vigilance is stifling to one hoping to live a life of free choices and privacy, and often the greatest threat to drowning devil's charges is the charges themselves, as many see suicide as the only way to escape the constant gaze of their eerie diabolic guardian." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruFaceWhal" name="Faceless Whale" description="Called &#147;ansiktsloshvals&#148; in Aklo, and sometimes called &#147;Darklands whales,&#148; faceless whales are enigmatic predators of the Sightless Sea rarely encountered elsewhere on Golarion. Like cavefish, faceless whales lost their eyes and pigmentation from countless generations spent living and breeding in the lightless depths. The lack of pigmentation leaves the creatures' skin little more than a transparent, blubberlined film, with pulsing veins and churning organs visible beneath the silvery membrane. Sailors' lore from the Sightless Sea claims a faceless whale's most recent meal shows through the taut skin of its belly.\n\nIt is unknown precisely how long faceless whales have inhabited the Sightless Sea. Some legends claim faceless whales began their lives as normal toothed whales that washed into the Darklands during the cataclysm of Earthfall, if not long before. Darker tales contend the faceless whales were driven into the realm of Orv by a coven of powerful sea hags, who robbed the faceless whales of their sight when they refused to teach the hags their potent song.\n\nAn adult faceless whale is 70 feet long and weights 90,000 pounds, though some specimens stretch these averages and grow half again as large.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nFaceless whales resemble the toothed whales common to the Arcadian Ocean in body structure, possessing a tapered mouth lined with stubby, conical teeth and a streamlined body. Lacking eyes, faceless whales depend totally upon their keen blindsight to navigate, seek prey, and avoid the predations of the Sightless Sea's most horrific inhabitants. Faceless whales prefer to hunt near the bottom of the Sightless Sea, where crushing pressures and freezing temperatures nurture large, sluggish organisms with few places to hide, and where the whales find safety from other menacing predators. Because of the unusual and outright alien composition of the creatures found within the lowest depths, faceless whales developed indiscriminate appetites. A hungry faceless whale consumes virtually any living thing it can gulp into its jaws, including the plentiful aquatic aberrations. Faceless whales can remain submerged for hours at a time, diving to depths of over 7,000 feet. Faceless whales that survive to adulthood in the harsh conditions of Orv live 80 years or longer.\n\nAs predators that spend the majority of their lives in the deepest waters, Darklands whales are rarely spotted. Those who sail upon the dark currents of the Sightless Sea and Lake Nirthran see these beasts only when the whales surface to breathe. When surfacing, a faceless whale breathes for minutes at a time, exhaling and inhaling massive volumes of air in great misty spouts.\n\nWhen a faceless whale finds prey it can easily outswim, it plunges downward with its mouth agape, snapping up the morsel before it can react. When pursuing larger or faster prey, the faceless whale becomes a persistence hunter, hounding its quarry at a deceptively leisurely pace. After what often proves to be days of dogged pursuit, the whale's prey becomes too exhausted to swim further. Before the quarry can marshal the last of its strength to defend itself, the faceless whale renders it helpless with a resonant song. When the faceless whale is not in combat, it uses this sonic attack to break through rock and gain access to new hunting grounds within Orv and beyond.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nFaceless whales typically hunt and swim alone, except when prey is abundant. When hunting is favorable, faceless whales organize into pods led by the oldest (and typically largest) female. Pods are short lived, often forming only a handful of times within a faceless whale's lifetime. As such, males compete fiercely for breeding rights during these gatherings. Pods last only as long as prey sustains them. Once food becomes scarce, the pod disperses into the Sightless Sea, and individual whales brave the chill waters alone in search of richer hunting grounds.\n\nMated pairs of faceless whales remain together only long enough to raise their first calf. This period of nurturing typically lasts no longer than 5 years-just enough time for the parents to teach a calf basic hunting strategies and witness its first unassisted kill. Afterward, the parents part ways, leaving the calf to mature to adulthood or perish in the uncertain depths of the abyss.\n\nA faceless whale spends the majority of its life in isolation, plumbing the depths of the Sightless Sea in search of prey, the occasional mate, and hunting grounds rich enough to support a temporary pod. When it makes such a discovery, a faceless whale circles the boundary of the new territory, calling out to its fellows with a groaning, dirge-like song that carries for leagues. Whalers who ply their trade upon the Sightless Sea listen for this dirge with fanatical obsession. Faceless whales provide numerous alchemical ingredients, and their bones and teeth make excellent weapons and armor. An adult faceless whale possesses enough of both to make a crew of whalers rich, provided they have the courage and skill to slay the creature.\n\nThough faceless whales prefer larger meals, they eagerly prey upon humanoids when other food is scarce. A sailor fallen overboard makes an easy snack for an adult or a full meal for a juvenile. Conventional wisdom claims that faceless whales consider seagoing vessels indigestible, but serpentfolk hiss tales of faceless whales of exceptional cunning that capsize or fracture ships and feast upon the drowning crews, plucking them from among the flotsam.\n\nOn rare occasion, a faceless whale finds its way into the oceans of Golarion. Some believe the creatures possess an instinctive knowledge of hidden waterways linking the Sightless Sea to the world above (perhaps all that remains of the migratory instincts that once drove their cetacean ancestors). Those few faceless whales that venture beyond the Darklands typically do so only briefly, breaching the surface on moonless nights just long enough to take in a breath of air free from the fetid staleness of Orv.\n\nMany sages postulate that the Sightless Sea is bottomless, its deepest trenches connecting to planes of primordial darkness where the pressure is capable of crushing living beings into stone. It is possible that the Sightless Sea is just one of many faceless whale hunting grounds. If this is the case, there is no telling what a faceless whale might bring up from the ebon depths." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruGargiya" name="Gargiya" description="Crueler and more volatile than their sea-serpent cousins, gargiyas gravitate toward and sustain themselves on seismic hotspots. Far from being a danger to the beasts, these bubbling crevices spew a form of magma that imbues gargiyas with incredible abilities. From birth, gargiyas ingest magma bubbling up from the ocean floor. By the time they've reached maturity, the monsters develop a molten core in their gullets that allows them to call forth scalding heat at will. Gargiyas' aggressive tendencies toward seafarers have garnered them a well-earned nickname-&#147;boiler beasts.&#148;\n\nGargiyas' affinity for all things volcanic has left a pattern of stippled crimson on their massive, snake-like bodies. The spiny frills jutting from their heads and necks resemble enormous, iron-forged blades, and hundreds of stubby appendages line the sides of their underbellies, wriggling ominously when the beasts rear from the sea. Of all the gargiyas' features, though, perhaps the most intimidating are their eyes and maws, which seethe with the light and heat of burning coals-particularly when the beasts are aggravated. Capable of slithering through water like an enormous python, a gargiya stretches 30 feet in length and weighs up to 5 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLegends of the seas say that early in gargiyas' existence, as the ocean floor around them shuddered and stretched, the warmth of the seas' burgeoning volcanoes fascinated the beasts. To the gargiyas, these seismic regions offered a siren call of safety, isolation and-unbeknownst to the animalistic creatures-power. While it's unclear just how it lends gargiyas such power, scholars agree that this magma serves as gargiyas' primary sustenance and as the source of their hyperthermal abilities.\n\nScholars believe that as gargiyas became more adept at manipulating heat, they became more protective of the magma vents they call home. Whereas early legends speak of gargiyas that rarely surfaced, preferring to stay close to their volcanic lairs, modern stories tell of gargiyas that see any sentient creatures-even if they're sailing a mile away-as threats to be met head-on. The few sailors who have survived these encounters warn of gargiyas that actively patrol the waters surrounding their magma vents, surfacing at even the slightest sign of unlucky passersby. Apparently, to the gargiyas, any who venture near their precious lairs must covet them.\n\nBecause of gargiyas' aggressiveness, a small subset of oceanic cartographers has devoted itself to recording the locations of their known lairs. These maps, available in many southern ports' markets, are popular among traders and pirates who wish to skirt fiery confrontation. However, in testament to the cutthroat competition between many port merchants, it's not unheard of for these maps to contain &#147;mistakes&#148;-oversights built into the guides by their previous owners, hoping to lure rivals to horrific doom, or protect favored shipping lanes.\n\nDespite gargiyas' destructive reputations, some Golarion cultures revere their molten cores as a symbol of status and wealth. Taldans, in particular, are drawn to the cores' seductively mysterious glow. The richest Taldan patriarchs often believe owning such a rare treasure-and showing it off, of course-is a worthy life goal. Careless of the risks gargiya hunts entail, these patriarchs sometimes sponsor teams of adventurers to quest for these cores. Most of these expeditions end in bloody and burning tragedy, but to some hardy sea-goers, the potential rewards of glory and riches are too alluring to resist.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nGargiyas mostly live alone near major archipelagos with abundant volcanic activity. They are most numerous in the isolated waters surrounding the Shackles, though scattered sightings have been reported throughout Golarion's warmer seas. There is a significant concentration of gargiyas near the Smoker where magma seeps up from the sea floor, and also talk of a stretch north of Shark Island where gargiya lairs speckle the ocean floor by the dozens. No one knows, however, whether this latter story is true or rather was concocted to deter authorities from the hideouts of buccaneers who roamed the islands before the sahuagin staked their claim there.\n\nGargiyas do not typically share their homes with others of their kind. However, sailors have told stories of defeating a gargiya after a long and brutal struggle only to come face to face with another one-ostensibly coming to its kin's aid. The question of whether these tales are simple exaggerations or evidence of gargiya collaboration has prompted many a fistfight in portside taverns. How well these braggarts fare in such brawls often indicates whether they're capable of the outlandish adventures they so boldly claim.\n\nAlthough tales of collaborating gargiyas are unsettling enough, even more sinister rumors have surfaced from seafarers who dare to brave the Eye of Abendego. There, the tales say, the turbulent seas beneath Golarion's permanent hurricane hide groups of gargiyas whipped into a frenzy by the tempest that followed Aroden's death a century ago. According to legend, these gargiyas roam the entire area of the Eye as predators, ambushing ships and boiling their crews in the ocean's salty waters. It is said that they decorate their volcanic lairs with their victims' bones, hinting that gargiyas possess an intelligence beyond that of mere animals.\n\nUnlike many reptilian creatures, gargiyas birth their young live. Scholars agree that, typically, male and female gargiyas come together to breed every decade or so. Afterward, the beasts abandon each other. When the female returns to her lair, she is thought to consume large amounts of magma while her single snakeling gestates, usually for a period of about 10 years. When giving birth, the gargiya expels her offspring into a magmaspewing fissure, where it grows and gathers strength until it leaves to find its own home. Although there is some debate about gargiyas' longevity, scholars believe they typically live around 300 years. Rumors, however, speak of gargiyas that have lived much longer-perhaps even predating modern civilization-but if any have encountered such an ancient terror and survived, they have never surfaced to tell the tale." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruLorelei" name="Lorelei" description="A lorelei resembles an enormous, stony sea anemone with a humanlike face covering much of its body. Noted for its ability to produce magical murmurs that entrance sailors navigating close to its lair, a lorelei is a magnet for destruction. The creatures lurk near rocky outcroppings and protuberances, barely concealed by crashing waves or rushing rivers, eager to lure humanoids to their deaths.\n\nAlso known as a &#147;murmuring stone&#148; for its rocklike natural camouflage, a lorelei is a solitary creature that shuns peaceful contact with other living things. It broods in the shadows of seaside cliffs and ocean trenches, emerging only to torment the living. When not pursuing more complicated schemes, a lorelei is fond of wrecking ships on nearby rocks and luring sailors beneath the surface to drown.\n\nSome claim these creature were once a species of beautiful fey cursed by foul forces. This claim is backed by the fact that they behave much like nereids, nixies, and sirens. A lorelei stands 9 feet tall, not counting the tentacles atop its body, and weighs around 2,000 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nA lorelei's body is barrel-shaped, with a foot known as a basal disk at the bottom. A lorelei's basal disk is less adhesive than that of a sea anemone but more flexible, allowing the lorelei to climb at a reasonable pace, and to swim by undulating its underside. At the top end of the lorelei's body, dozens of tentacles surround a toothless maw that it uses to ingest food.\n\nIn addition to these strange features, the lorelei has a humanlike face that covers much of its body on one side. The mouth on the lorelei's face cannot consume food-it exists only to produce speech and other sounds. In contrast, a lorelei's eyes are fully functional. The lorelei has no ears, but can sense sound with its entire body, having a range of hearing comparable to that of an average human.\n\nA lorelei's brain is located behind its face, protected by a plate of cartilage. That hard plate is the only part of a lorelei's body that isn't yielding and rubbery. A lorelei's hide is difficult to crush and cut, serving as surprisingly effective natural armor. This skin is also camouflaged with a rocklike appearance. A lorelei can retract its tentacles to take on the appearance of a boulder, allowing it to remain hidden until its prey is too close to escape.\n\nTrue to their rarity and solitary nature, loreleis reproduce asexually. Every few decades, a lorelei can produce another of its kind by splitting off a single piece of its body, which then grows into a young lorelei. Offspring produced in this manner inherit portions of their parent's memories, giving them fully functioning adult minds without any need for instruction or socialization.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nA lorelei prefers a lonesome and solitary existence, shunning its own kind as readily as it shuns all living things. Brooding and morose, loreleis enjoy only one thing: making other, happier creatures suffer. Loreleis regularly orchestrate conflicts, shipwrecks, and other disasters to celebrate the cruel hand of fate that rules the nihilistic world they see everywhere they look.\n\nSince it rarely wanders far from its rocky lair, a lorelei sits in wait, sometimes for weeks, hoping for a victim to come within range of its murmured song. Though it will fight to keep its lair, a lorelei dislikes prolonged conflict and abandons its rocky outcroppings or underwater caves if the location receives too much visitation or attention. Sometimes a lorelei maintains two or three lairs in order to move between them regularly, thus attracting less attention to each location." compset="Race">

When a lorelei murmurs, all creatures aside from other lorelei within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 20 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same lorelei's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the murmur moves toward the lorelei using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Affected creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the lorelei simply stands and offers no resistance to the its attacks. This effect continues for as long as the lorelei murmurs and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based." compset="RaceSpec">

Nothosaurs are also similar in many ways to seals-they spend much of their time in the water, including when they hunt, but emerge to sleep and breed on land. They lay their eggs in massive sandy mounds in the summer, then abandon their nests and slip back into the sea. A nothosaur is most vulnerable out of the water, but when caught unawares, it can return to the water with alarming speed, notwithstanding its awkwardly short legs and disproportionately large neck and tail. Nothosaurs can exist in water of any temperature, but prefer the warmer equatorial waters. Herds of nothosaurs make seasonal migrations, following schools of fish over the course of many months.

  <thing id="ruSeawdSir" name="Seaweed Siren" description="A seaweed siren stands over 8 feet tall from the tip of its stubby legs to the top of its heads, and is nearly 7 feet in diameter. The creature weighs upward of 3,500 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nSeaweed sirens hunt near the shore, where they wait for clam diggers strolling the beaches, lone fisherfolk, or even passing ships. Once a seaweed siren spots its prey, the creature lurks just under the water and allows its three strange heads to protrude above the surface. The swaying heads sing songs and babble in strange nonsense languages to fuel the seaweed siren's many special abilities. Even when not in use against a potential meal, the heads seemingly converse with each other, holding lengthy conversations full of random syllables and made-up words. Once it draws its prey near, the seaweed siren attempts to charm or bewilder its foe to gain the advantage. After this, the creature moves closer and begins to devour its still-living victim. While the seaweed siren prefers to dine on living humanoids, it uses its strident squall attacks to incapacitate or kill prey that flees or resists its charm attempts.\n\nSeaweed sirens use a form of aggressive mimicry, appearing to have humanoid features in order to lure in their preferred meals. A seaweed siren's heads are nothing more than appendages. While they have mouths the creature can breathe through, it doesn't eat using these mouths. Seaweed sirens' heads grow differently depending on where the creature developed in order to match the skin tone and apparent ethnicity of the surrounding humanoid population. In addition, the heads are eyeless-the siren sees using the many eyes on its main body mass. A seaweed siren's eyes twist and spin within their sockets when the creature uses its terrible gaze attack.\n\nWhen seaweed sirens can't find their favored food-intelligent creatures and humanoids-they can subsist on fish, but they prefer aquatic mammals as an alternative. Seals and sea otters find their way into a seaweed siren's mouth most often, but the creature must actively hunt those morsels, as its particular bait is ineffective against the animals and more likely to scare them off than to lure them closer.\n\nSome sailors report larger and more dangerous variations of the seaweed siren. If these reports are true, some seaweed sirens measure twice the size of regular ones, and possess more than three heads and more powerful abilities.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSeaweed sirens live solitary lives, rarely if ever encountering others of their kind. It's unclear to scholars how these creatures procreate, but they must have some method, since they've been spotted along Golarion's coasts for thousands of years. Some who research the strange monsters pose the theory that seaweed sirens birth their young from thick leathery shells, much like turtle eggs or fibrous seeds.\n\nSeaweed sirens sometimes ally themselves with other aquatic creatures to share in hunts or for mutual protection. Sahuagin typically don't trust the seaweed sirens, nor do they have the patience to work too closely with the creatures for long, but they have been known to befriend a seaweed siren and work with it long enough to capture new slaves and restock their humanoid food supply. Locathah sometimes use these strange beasts as protectors, keeping the seaweed sirens well fed in return for the creatures serving as lookouts and sentinels. Merfolk and aquatic elves avoid seaweed sirens, and even go so far as to sometimes warn other humanoid communities when one is discovered to be hunting nearby.\n\nA seaweed siren can speak Aklo, and constantly babbles in glossolalia, but if it manages to talk with another sentient being that has a language long enough, it begins mimicking the other's language and speech patterns, eventually sounding exactly like it. Though a seaweed siren can use its tongues spell to understand and speak any language, it prefers to talk with and mimic its conversational partners without resorting to using this ability. Some speculate the creature catalogs every conversation in order to add to the collection of sounds and words that power its cacophony special ability." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruIncutili" name="Incutilis" description="Scholars know life began in the sea, and some- either paranoid or visionary-claim that the sea has manipulated the course of humanoid life through ages beyond reckoning, citing the incutilis as evidence of this. A strange sort of sea creature that appears to be little more than an oversized cephalopod, an incutilis hides a significant intelligence behind its unassuming appearance. Though most incutilises live their entire lives amid the deepest trenches of the darkest seas, some venture to the border between water and land, revealing terrible control over land-dwelling flesh and an alien disregard for sentient life. Limited in their ability to cross this border and travel on land by their aquatic physiologies, these aberrations overcome this hurdle with a lethal solution, slaying land dwellers and commandeering their flesh to bear the incutilis on shore. To what ends these beings seek to explore the surface remains a mystery-perhaps they do so out of hunger, perhaps out of curiosity, or perhaps because they were sent.\n\nA typical incutilis weighs approximately 25 pounds, 30 with its shell, and measures 4 feet from the tips of its longest tentacles to the top of its shell.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAlthough incutilises can live as bottom feeders, their favorite foods seem to be higher life forms-sharks, whales, and sentient ocean dwellers-and they appear to make little distinction between the living and the dead. They also make no obvious distinctions between sentient and nonsentient victims, a trait that comes across as either an extreme form of racial arrogance or total ruthlessness. At the same time, incutilises exhibit strong self-preservation compulsions, going out of their way to avoid dangerous predators and large groups of other sentient beings, and preferring instead to operate from the shadows.\n\nIncutilises' most remarkable physical process is their ability to invasively take over dead flesh. So long as a body is relatively intact, the aberration can extend the smaller, more delicate tendrils it typically keeps retracted into its shell. These tendrils are covered with myriad tiny barbs and smaller fibrous filaments it can wind into even the finest internal apertures of a living body with shocking speed and ease. Once the tendrils are in place, the strange chemical laboratory that makes up a incutilis's internal organs allows it to secrete strange chemicals and toxins directly into the body's muscles, causing deliberate contractions, releases, and convulsions that give freshly dead bodies the semblance of life, while those longer dead appear undead. This process requires the incutilis to be latched onto its victim, directing its every motion. If it retracts its tendrils, its host body collapses back into a pile of dead flesh.\n\nDespite the remarkable nature of incutilises' corpse animation process, it is far from subtle. An incutilis cannot easily hide its prominent tendrils and gleaming shell, meaning that any corpse looks far from normal in well-lit conditions. In the dark or at a distance, however, the illusion can prove somewhat convincing, though still unnerving as the body twitches and jerks with the spasms caused by its aquatic master. Typically, witnesses who see a corpse animated by an incutilis believe it to be some sort of waterlogged undead, a misidentification that has led to the demise of more than one well-intentioned cleric.\n\nIncutilises can survive both on land and at sea, though they are at an obvious disadvantage out of water, as their bodies are specialized for swimming, not dragging themselves along dry terrain. This limit to their mobility seems to be the primary reason they seek out corpses to take control over or unsuspecting humanoids or animals to overwhelm, claiming their bodies as convenient conveyances. Despite this, their actions rarely seem deliberately malicious, but rather result from a decision made out of dispassionate necessity. Whether they realize that their method of taking over the bodies of other living creatures is an affront to such beings or even have any concept of what death means proves entirely unclear.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThose few aware of incutilises rarely know the creatures by name. Rather, tales of their terrors-of shambling, flesh-garbed cephalopods and whole villages overwhelmed by invaders from the deep-spread through ports and among crews of sailors, the stuff of tall tales and the lies of drunks. But regularly enough, coastal fishing communities or the fortresses of petty pirate kings turn up deserted, their occupants vanished except, occasionally, for a few strange, oversized nautilus shells.\n\nIncutilises can turn up in nearly any body of saltwater, but seem to favor warmer climes. More than even seeking warmer waters, however, these aquatic aberrations most frequently appear near deep undersea trenches. This is possibly because of some preference for the pressure of the depths or the darkness, but some also propose that incutilises are natives of the Darklands and inhabit the lightless seas of that realm in numbers unprecedented in the seas of the surface. This somewhat unpredictable range of habits has resulted in rumors of incutilises appearing in the most unusual places, like freshwater ponds, inland fishing holes, even wells.\n\nIncutilises prove highly logical in their decision-making, seeming to know nothing of or care nothing for emotion or sympathy. This causes many who first encounter them to believe they're nothing more than ravenous creatures, flesh stealers driven to hunt beyond their native environments. In truth, groups of incutilises act with great eff iciency and deliberateness. Such bands also gauge the potential of a possible new food source before acting to claim it, avoiding acts that would eliminate their entire food source too quickly. They might kill off a few coastal communities, but avoid wiping out entire coastal populations in a region. In other cases, a group of corpse-riding incutilises might capture a signif icant portion of a community's population, trapping their victims in sea caves where the incutilises can come an go as they please, where others of their race can come and collect bodies to use on land, or where their prey are sequestered like herd animals." compset="Race">
