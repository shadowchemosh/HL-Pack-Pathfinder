  <thing id="psPUAuGAv8" name="Gate of Avernus" description="You tear open a hole in the planes, bringing forth a gate to the Ethereal Plane.\n\nCreating a {i}gate of Avernus{/i} has two effects.\n\nFirst, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and the Ethereal Plane, allowing travel between these two planes in either direction.\n\nSecond, you may call a particular ethereal individual or kind of incorporeal being through the gate of Avernus.\n\nWhen you manifest this power, you dedicate a part of yourself to maintaining it. Any power points that you spent manifesting this power cannot be regained or restored while the power exists. In addition, you suffer 1d6 points of Constitution and Wisdom drain when you finish manifestation.\n\nThe {i}gate of Avernus{/i} is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (manifester&apos;s choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when manifesting the power, and anyone or anything that fulfills your entry terms, if any, that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. However, this travel is not without risk. Those that would cross from the Ethereal Plane suffer 1d6 Wisdom drain, while those that would cross into the Ethereal Plane suffer 1d6 Constitution drain. Otherwise, this functions much like a {i}plane shift{/i}.\n\n{i}Planar Travel:{/i} For this use, you may set entry terms, if you wish. If you do so, you may choose either keyed entry, only allowing certain people, or only allowing a certain type of people. Once you decide on these terms, they cannot be changed.\n\nIn the first case, any one in possession of a key or specific, special object, or knowing a certain passphrase may pass. This key or phrase must be decided when manifesting this power, and cannot be changed.\n\nIn the second case, you may indicate a number of people up to your manifester level when you manifest this power. These people, as well as yourself, are the only targets that may pass. No disguise, spell, or effect can fool this power.\n\nIn the third case, you may indicate a certain characteristic that all who would pass must share. This can be as concrete as alignment, hair color, or possession of a certain class ability, or as abstract as deity worshiped or personal philosophy.\n\n{i}Calling Creatures:{/i} The second use of this power is to call forth powerful spirits from the Ethereal Plane. By naming a particular being or kind of being as you manifest this power (which must have the incorporeal subtype or be native to the Ethereal Plane, or this power fails, not expending any material components), you cause the gate of Avernus to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the {i}gate of Avernus{/i}, although may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of this power creates a {i}gate of Avernus{/i} that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of this power has a material cost of 10,000 gp in intricate scrimshaw and rare tributes. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.\n\nIf you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your manifester level, and they must either have the incorporeal subtype or be native to the Ethereal Plane. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your manifester level. A creature with more HD than your manifester level can&apos;t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to the Ethereal Plane at any time.\n\nIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the {i}lesser planar ally{/i} spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in &quot;livestock&quot;, time spent possessing a mortal body, memories, or emotions (negative levels and ability drain) rather than in coin. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\n\nFailure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you." compset="PsiPower">

  <thing id="psPUAuHFe5" name="Horrid Fetter" description="By using this power, you attempt to bind an incorporeal creature to an object important to it, which must lie within the powers&apos; range. The called creature is bound to the object and to your service until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.\n\nFirst, you must locate an object important to that creature. This can the breath of a dying man, a bloodied sword, or be an object that holds significance to members of its type (a mirror for a mirror shade, for example). When calling a specific individual, you would use things like an item that it wielded in life, a picture of it, the tears of its widow, or its corporeal remains if it is undead. The type of creature must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual&apos;s proper name in manifesting this power.\n\nThe target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the power. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the object (power resistance does not keep it from being called), and is unable to harm or act against you for as long as you hold or own the object it is bound to. You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various psionic sigils) to make the circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\n\nA successful diagram allows you to manifest a {i}wrench{/i} spell on the circle during the round before manifesting any summoning power. The anchor holds any called creatures in the circle for 24 hours per manifester level. A creature cannot use its power resistance against a circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see below), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above\n\nThe creature can flee from you by successfully pitting its power resistance against your manifester level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your manifester level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. If the creature is held within a successful circle enhanced by wrench (as described above), they may not escape by dimensional travel.\n\nIf the creature does not break free of this power, you may keep it bound for as long as you wish. You can attempt to compel a creature to perform a service by describing the service and either offering some sort of reward or damaging the object to attempt to coerce it. In either case, you can only attempt to issue the creature commands or negotiate for services once in a 24-hour period, and impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.\n\nFor the former case, you make a Charisma check opposed by the creature&apos;s Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other effect. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the power&apos;s effect and can escape or attack you.\n\nIn the latter case, you may damage the object a total of five times to attempt to compel the creature. After the fifth time, the object breaks, and this power ends. When you damage the item (a standard action), the creature takes damage equal to half its maximum hit points, round up, and is sickened for 1 round/level. Instead of taking damage, the creature may follow one command you give it to the best of its ability.\n\nOnce the service or command is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the power remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per manifester level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was called). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions." compset="PsiPower">
