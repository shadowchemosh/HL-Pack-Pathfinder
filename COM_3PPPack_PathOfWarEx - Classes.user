  <thing id="cPWHarbngr" name="Harbinger" description="Like rumors of war or plague-ridden winds, Harbingers move through battlefields and leave only ruin and sorrow in their wake. Empowered from within by a deep connection to sorrow, grief, and wrath, Harbingers channel their negative emotions into a supernatural fighting style that is strange and terrifying to behold. Some accept the darker urges within themselves but leash them, making their wrath serve as a hound might - and others embrace the violence within, becoming killers without restraint or pity.\n\n{b}Adventures:{/b} Harbingers adventure for many and sundry reasons, ranging from simple greed to revenge to genuine altruism. Many Harbingers learn their trade from a mentor or master who sometimes imparts a mission or task to them, or initiates them into an organization that retains the Harbinger as its agent. Harbingers aren’t any less likely to take to the adventuring life out of friendship than anyone else and may be found in the company of mercenaries they’ve grown to love, or at least no longer feel like they can live without.\n \n{b}Characteristics:{/b} Regardless of their alignment, religion, culture of origin, or beliefs all Harbingers have one thing in common - violence. For some anger and sorrow are tools they use to do their jobs, an acknowledgement that all sapients have both good and evil within. For others violence marks and defines their lives, with angry scars and psychological wounds. Some crumble before the anger within, becoming little more than puppets for their hate, and others refuse to give in and display a level of self-control that can only be called saintlike. However, all Harbingers live their lives coming - or failing to come - to terms with the darkness within. \n\n{b}Alignment:{/b} Any. Though Harbingers are marked by their darker urges they are not utterly defined by them, and many brave and noble souls succeed in staring into the abyss until the abyss averts its gaze. It is true that many Harbingers skew towards evil and/or chaos, but nothing stops an Harbinger from turning their power to altruistic ends.\n\n{b}Religion:{/b} Harbingers tend to be on one side or the other of the line between piety and indifference when it comes to religion. Many Harbingers that have been scarred by violence or evil shy away from faith, unable to believe that higher powers truly influence their lives. Others embrace gods of violence, vengeance, tyranny or destruction out of a feeling of common sympathy or even obligation. Good-aligned Harbingers tend to worship gods of justice or retribution, taking on the role of those who dispense justice to the wicked, or to gravitate towards gods they seek to emulate - gods of peace, love, or beauty that remind the Harbingers of the things they choose to defend.\n\n{b}Background:{/b} At some point in their lives, all Harbingers encountered the violence within. Some come from cursed or tainted backgrounds, dragged towards power by fiendish blood or maledictions laid down upon their ancestors. Others have inherent but untapped magical potential that erupts in a moment of wrath or panic, and many Harbingers have started on their path with blood dripping from their fingers and a look of shocked panic on their face. Harbingers tend to be from places marked or scarred by strife, and the majority emerge from lands wracked by civil war, military conflict, massive social change, crushing poverty or endemic crime, though this may be because the circumstances that awaken their power are so much more common in such places. \n\nIt is possible to deliberately train an Harbinger, though magical potential must be present. Such master-student relationships are less common than ‘wild’ Harbingers but can often end up with an Harbinger that understands her own power much better. Some teachers use cruel and sadistic training methods to force their student to confront the anger inside of them, while others ask that their pupils meditate on the nature of evil and its role in the multiverse. Both approaches are effective, and produce very different students. \n\n{b}Races:{/b} Any race capable of feeling anger, sorrow, or grief can potentially become an Harbinger. That said, some are certainly more common than others. Savage humanoids such as orcs or gnolls produce a large number of Harbingers; their day-to-day lives are marked with violence and maliciousness. Humans and part-humans (but especially tieflings) also make up a large part of Harbinger membership, both because of the significant role negative emotions play in their lives and the endemic poverty and crime rates found in their cities. In contrast, races with gentle day-to-day lives such as elves or dwarves produce Harbingers more rarely, and even then usually as part of a master-student relationship.\n\n{b}Other Classes:{/b} Harbingers can often have difficulty around divinely empowered classes such as clerics and paladins, most often because of the ultimate source of their power. Paladins in particular tend to disapprove of Harbingers utilizing evil urges, even for good ends, and the conflicts between the two can run long and deep. \n\n{b}Role:{/b} Control. Harbingers command the battlefield with a combination of superior mobility and debilitating strikes, determining when and how they want to engage and targeting weak enemies while shutting stronger ones out of the battle. Their spread of supernatural maneuvers gives Harbingers access to magical and unusual abilities that can shift the tide of battle in their favor." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

  <thing id="cPWZealot" name="Zealot" description="A warhawk politician grimly but eloquently calls for the destruction of a hated enemy. A loyal guard lays down his life for his homeland without hesitation. A cultist is driven to greater and greater ecstasies of blood to satisfy the wicked whispers that fill his mind day and night. All believe that if they sacrifice enough for their dreams, even the impossible can be realized. These dreams are enough to shape those around them - and, if realized - the world.\n\n{b}Adventures:{/b} Zealots live in pursuit of a passion or cause. Each zealot has a purpose they intimately understand, from protecting their country, to spreading their religion, to hunting down every last one of the assassins who murdered their master.\n\n{b}Characteristics:{/b} Zealots typically have intense personalities - despite their commitment to one cause, if one fire cools, another will ignite. This fervency is what draws in their allies and sets them apart: What some might believe on an intellectual level in a vague, apathetic way, the zealot embraces and knows like a lover.\n\n{b}Alignment:{/b} Any. Zealots have a strict devotion to an ideal that they follow with reckless abandon. While zealots often allow the ends to justify the means, they also put the needs of something greater than themselves beyond their own needs. These conflicting motivations create zealots of every conceivable stripe. Though zealots do not change alignment more frequently than other classes, a zealot who changes alignments fights for his new ideals with the same intensity as the one he left behind.\n\n{b}Religion:{/b} Many zealots are religious, but their personal beliefs often clash with established dogma. Zealots often live at the extremes of a given religion - its most brutal enforcers, its most devout preachers, its first followers, its greatest defenders, and its most despised heretics. This purity of drive leads zealots to frequently found their own religions, philosophies, and cults. \n\n{b}Background:{/b} Zealots are found most frequently in times of uncertainty and places of conflict, though whether this is because these situations are ideal for creating zealots, zealots are drawn to these areas, or zealots create these situations is uncertain. \n\n{b}Races:{/b} Zealots are most commonly found in humans and other shorter-lived races, because zealots often live short and burn bright. Sadly, there may be just as many dwarven patriots as goblin fanatics, but the dwarves who follow less impassioned lives will typically live much longer ones. Half-breeds like half-orcs, half-giants, and tieflings are common zealots, as they are often born in areas of conflict and are forced into allying with one side of their heritage or another. Dromites and other highly-organized races can produce excellent zealots, as their culture helps instill them with a unique sense of purpose.\n\n{b}Other Classes:{/b} Zealots often mesh best with others who will fight for their cause, regardless of their allies’ motivations - a pragmatic stalker who can be counted on to perform a task for a few coins might be a more trusted ally than a pious cleric who is always raising moral arguments to the zealot’s methods. Zealots sometimes clash with sorcerers, paladins, and others with strong personalities (a natural consequence of too many leaders and not enough followers), but thoughtful classes like inquisitors, oracles, and rangers can channel the zealot’s ardor against the proper targets. Zealots do not inherently get along well, and there are often zealots on all sides of a conflict.\n\n{b}Role:{/b} Leader. A zealot inspires the hearts and minds of those he fights alongside through pure passion, bringing his allies to heights they never thought possible. With proper feat and maneuver choices, zealots can also become masters of battlefield control." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

  <thing id="cPW5Collec" name="Collective" description="A zealot learns to use psionic power to connect willing minds through an internal network that strengthens their psychic bonds. As a standard action, a zealot can join any number of willing targets into his collective (up to his limit, see below). The zealot must have line of sight to each target, each target must have a Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level). The collective can contain up to his Charisma modifier or half his zealot level (minimum 1), whichever is higher, plus the intensity of his zeal. The zealot is always considered a member of his own collective, and does not count against this limit. \n\nThe zealot can choose to remove a member as a free action on his turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of range of the collective is automatically removed. If a member enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until the member leaves the field. A member who leaves the collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from being a member. A zealot is aware of the status of his collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling if such a creature is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy below).\n\nA zealot can initiate certain maneuvers through his collective. If a zealot maneuver specifies one or more willing targets (or is harmless) and has a range greater than personal, he can initiate this maneuver on a member of his collective regardless of the range of the actual maneuver. All other non-range restrictions still apply. \n\nIf he is capable of manifesting powers, casting spells, or initiating maneuvers from a different class (as is the case for a multiclass zealot), any compatible spell, power, or maneuver with a range greater than touch can also be used through the collective. He may manifest any power with the Network Descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or targets.\n\nIf a member of the collective dies, the member is removed from the collective and the zealot must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1 power point for every Hit Die of the fallen member or be sickened for an equal number of rounds.\n\nAt 15th level, a zealot&apos;s collective range is limitless on the same plane as the zealot\n\nAt 19th level, a zealot&apos;s range reaches even across other planes and dimensions." compset="ClSpecial">

  <thing id="cPWMystic" name="Mystic" description="Born with an untamed magical power buried deep within his soul, the mystic is a warrior who, much like a sorcerer, is filled with untapped energies. This power however, is too primal and unstable, and is difficult to be formed effectively into a spell. By following a martial medium to tame this energy, the mystic is able to shape his wild power into martial maneuvers and this allows him to discover the deeper mysteries of his own inborn power.\n\n{b}Adventures:{/b} Most mystics adventure to stretch the limits of their powers, learning to master the mysteries within their souls. Some do it to express their power in ways that suit their ethics, for good or for ill, and others travel to find others like themselves, to study and train with and hope to eventually learn more about why they are the way they are.\n\n{b}Characteristics:{/b} Mystics tend to be a very introspective lot, wielding a power so foreign to most with an intuitive sense of understanding. Many mystics follow ascetic lifestyles, hoping that the order and abstaining of life’s vices will help them control their power. Others embrace their wild energies and move with the moment, pausing to reflect at the end of the day as to what drives their motivations.\n\n{b}Alignment:{/b} Any. Mystics do not follow any ethical or moral path, and choose their own destiny. Some cling to lawful alignments to master their powers, and others embrace chaotic alignments to freely express their talents.\n\n{b}Religion:{/b} Mystics who follow religion often find their faith with gods of  battle, nature, magic, or freedom.\n\n{b}Background:{/b} Mystics universally have one thing in common, and that’s a magical creature or magic-using being in their near family history. This power is an inherited consequence of such relation, and while it is not widely understood why it has chosen to manifest in such a way, the mystic’s wild power is usually an expression of this relation’s own power. Mystics are born, and must train to master their energies.\n\n{b}Races:{/b} Any member of any race could be a mystic, provided they had the ancestry and proper training available. Most commonly they are of the human, elven, and gnome races. Among monster races, kobolds and their draconic bloodlines are among the first and foremost experts in the realm of mysticism, and many fey or elemental blooded creatures as well.\n\n{b}Other Classes:{/b} Mystics tend to chafe with sorcerers around, as they see each other as failed expressions of the other. Otherwise, mystics find the most in common with rangers and monks for either their freedom or their discipline. Wizards find them interesting and enjoy studying their powers, and martially inclined characters find them to be steady and useful allies.\n\n{b}Role:{/b} A mystic will often find themselves in the role of both striker and party supporter. The glyphs they manifest will aid themselves and their allies, as their animus builds power and strength. Not as hardy as other warriors, however, mystics will find themselves needing the protection of their more robust allies from time to time." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

  <thing id="cPW6Animus" name="Animus" description="A mystic’s martial prowess is in part fueled by a reservoir of roiling, turbulent energy within her soul, and the passion and danger of combat causes this arcane energy to overflow outwards. This power, called animus, waxes and wanes with a mystic’s use of her maneuvers in battle. Outside combat, a mystic has no animus to spend, but her inner power can still be used for more subtle arcane arts. Her levels in mystic count as arcane spellcaster levels for the purposes of qualifying for prerequisites (such as those of item creation feats or the Arcane Strike feat), and if a mystic ever develops arcane spellcasting from another class, she may add her mystic level to her levels in that class to determine her overall caster level for the purposes of item creation feats.\n\nWhen a mystic enters combat, she gains an animus pool equal to 1 + her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) at the start of her first turn, and adds one point of animus to her animus pool at the start of each turn thereafter. Her animus pool persists for one minute after the last enemy combatant is defeated or the encounter otherwise ends. At the end of any round in which the mystic initiates a maneuver (a strike, boost, or counter), she adds an additional point of animus to her pool. Certain abilities, such as some class features, maneuvers, and feats, require the mystic to expend points of animus to use. \n\nThe primal power of animus can be used in several ways – the foremost of which is the augmentation of maneuvers. Many maneuvers in the Elemental Flux discipline can be augmented by spending points of animus (see the maneuver descriptions for more details), and the mystic can augment maneuvers in additional ways as well.\n\nStarting at 1st level, a mystic may spend a single point of animus to augment a maneuver as part of that maneuver’s initiation action to apply one of the following effects to it (if applicable):\n\n• {b}Enhance Maneuver:{/b} For each point of animus spent, the mystic adds a cumulative +2 insight bonus to all d20 rolls made (including attack rolls, CMB rolls, and skill checks) when initiating that maneuver (maximum of three animus may be spent on this augmentation); if the maneuver allows the user to make multiple attacks, then this bonus only applies to the first attack.\n• {b}Increase DC:{/b} For each point of animus spent, the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against that maneuver increases by 1.\n\nWhen the mystic reaches 4th level, she may spend up to two points of animus on maneuver augmentations, rather than one, and she gains access to the following additional augmentations:\n\n• {b}Anima Burn:{/b} The mystic adds ½ her class level to damage rolls made during that maneuver. This augment costs two points of animus, and can only be applied once to a given maneuver.\n• {b}Increase Potency:{/b} For each point of animus spent, you may ignore 10 points of energy resistance or 5 points of damage reduction.\n\nWhen the mystic reaches 9th level, she may now spend up to three points of animus on maneuver augmentations, and gains access to the following additional augmentation:\n\n• {b}Increase Range:{/b} The mystic may target a creature within 30 feet with a strike that normally uses a melee attack. Resolve the strike normally, as if the targeted creature was within the mystic’s melee reach. This augmentation costs two points of animus. \n• {b}Animus Rush:{/b} The mystic make move up to her base movement speed as part of the initiation action for the maneuver before initiating the strike. This is a teleportation effect and the mystic must clearly see her destination. This augmentation costs three points of animus.\n\nAt 13th level you may spend up to four points of animus on maneuver augmentation, and again at 19th level, you may increase this to five points of animus per augmentation." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Gain an Animus pool that you can spend to enhance maneuvers">

When a mystic readies her maneuvers, she may select one of the following elements (and associated energy type) to be her active element: air (electricity), earth (acid), fire (fire), and water (cold). \n\nAfter readying maneuvers, a mystic can change her active element by taking a standard action to focus inwards, or by expending one point of animus as a free action while assuming a new stance. Whenever she initiates a maneuver that deals damage, she may spend one point of animus as part of its initiation action to change all damage the maneuver deals to her active element’s associated energy type. For example, if a mystic whose active element is currently Air initiated the Cursed Fate Veiled Moon strike, she could spend one point of animus to change her attack’s damage (including the strike’s bonus damage) to from her weapon’s normal damage type to electricity damage.\n\nIf the mystic has access to the Elemental Flux discipline, then her active element from this class feature is the same as her active element for Elemental Flux maneuvers. Likewise, if she is psionic and has an active energy type, her active energy type and your active element are synonymous, and any effect which changes one changes both (exception being acid and sonic damage, which for these purposes are both considered earth for Elemental Attunement and Elemental Flux)." compset="ClSpecial">

As a move action, the mystic can spend one point of animus to apply an elemental glyph to a number of allies equal to her Wisdom modifier within her sight. The effect of this glyph depends on the element it is associated with, but all glyphs last for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the mystic’s Wisdom modifier. A mystic is not limited to casting glyphs of her active element (as darkness, illumination, and metal have no elemental type). Allies may only be affected by one of her glyphs at a time, with new glyphs ending the current glyph in effect and replacing it on the affected ally. The benefits of these glyphs are cumulative (for example, an 8th level mystic grants both the 3rd level and 8th level benefits to her allies). Different glyphs from different mystics may apply to the same target. Glyphs are supernatural abilities and not subject to spells or effects like {i}dispel magic{/i} but do not function within an {i}antimagic field{/i} or similar effect.\n\n {b}Air:{/b} The glyph of air fills the mystic’s allies with energy and speed. \n• At 3rd level, each of the movement speeds of affected allies increases by 10 feet and they make up to one 90 degree turn while making charge attacks. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. \n• At 8th level, this bonus increases to 30 feet, and they may make Acrobatics checks to jump as if they had a running start.\n• At 13th level, allies affected by the glyph of air gain the ability to move up to 30 feet as a swift action. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. \n• At 19th level, whenever one of the mystic’s allies uses the glyph of air’s swift action movement ability, they can make a single attack with a weapon they are wielding at their highest base attack bonus at any point during this movement.\n\n•{b}Darkness:{/b} Though darkness often connotates evil, for the mystic its shroud offers both protection and insight, allowing the mystic’s allies tactical avenues that they would otherwise be unable to access. \n• At 3rd level, allies affected by the glyph of darkness gain concealment (20% miss chance).  \n• At 8th level, affected allies gain darkvision and the effects of a see invisibility spell out to a range of 60 feet.\n• At 13th level, affected allies are shrouded in a pitch-black veil, gaining total concealment (50% miss chance).\n• At 19th level, affected allies gain the blindsight trait, with a range of 30-ft, when affected by this glyph.\n\n\n{b}Earth:{/b} The dour, steadfast nature of earth allows the mystic’s allies to better stand their ground and weather assaults. \n• At 3rd level, this glyph makes allies more difficult to move against their will; affected allies gain a bonus to their CMD equal to the mystic’s Wisdom modifier. \n• At 8th level, affected allies gain DR/adamantine equal to the mystic’s Wisdom modifier.\n• At 13th level, affected allies gain resistance to all energy types equal to the mystic’s class level.\n• At 19th level, affected allies cannot die from hit point loss - when reduced to 0 or few hit points, they are instead stabilized at 0 hit points until the glyph’s effects expire.\n\n{b}Fire:{/b} The unquenchable flames of passion drive the mystic’s allies to feats of glory. \n• At 3rd level, affected allies gain a circumstance bonus to attack rolls equal to ¼ the mystic’s class level (minimum +1).\n• At 8th level, affected allies add ½ the mystic’s class level as fire damage to attacks they make.\n• At 13th level, affected allies’ attacks ignore a number of points of energy resistance  equal to the mystic’s class level.\n• At 19th level, whenever an affected ally is targeted by a melee attack, the attacker takes fire damage equal to the mystic’s class level, regardless of whether or not the attack hits\n\n{b}Illumination:{/b} The light of the universe reveals truth wherever it hides.\n• At 3rd level, affected allies’ attacks ignore the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment\n• At 8th level, affected allies gain a bonus to Will saving throws against illusion spells and effects equal to the mystic’s Wisdom modifier .\n• At 13th level, affected allies gain the effects of a true seeing spell out to a range of 30 feet.\n• At 19th level, affected allies are protected from any falsehood, gaining the effects of a mind blank spell.\n\n{b}Metal:{/b} Sturdy and unyielding like the forged iron from which it takes its name, the glyph of metal imparts resolute strength to the mystic’s allies.\n• At 3rd level, affected allies increase their natural armor bonus to AC equal to ¼ the mystic’s class level (minimum +1).\n• At 8th level, affected allies gain a circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves equal to ¼ the mystic’s class level (minimum +1).\n• At 13th level, affected allies’ attacks ignore a number of points of damage reduction and hardness equal to the mystic’s Wisdom modifier.\n• At 19th level, affected allies gain DR/- equal to the mystic’s Wisdom modifier and gain spell resistance equal to 15 +  the mystic’s class level.\n\n{b}Water:{/b} Fluid and changeable, the glyph of water grants allies flexibility in both their movement and their thinking.\n• At 3rd level, affected allies gain a circumstance bonus to their CMB and to Swim checks equal to the mystic’s Wisdom modifier.\n• At 8th level, affected allies ignore difficult terrain when they move.\n• At 13th level, affected allies gain the effects of a freedom of movement spell.\n• At 19th level, affected allies gain fast healing of 10 while under the effects of this glyph." compset="ClSpecial" summary="As a move action, grant one of several suites of elemental abilities to your allies">

If the mystic is targeted by a spell, spell-like ability, or psionic power that normally would have a lesser effect (such as a partial effect) on a successful Fortitude or Reflex saving throw, she may make a Will saving throw instead of the effect’s normal save. If that Will saving throw is successful, she is completely unaffected by the spell or power, taking no damage and suffering no ill-effects. If she fails the saving throw, she suffers the effect as normal, and adds one point of animus to her animus pool. \n\nThe mystic must be unencumbered and wearing light or no armor to use this ability. This ability does not protect the mystic from traps, extraordinary or supernatural abilities, or any other effects that require a Fortitude or Reflex save.
