Psychic is now fully scripted and will change its bonus based on the number of psi-points a character has. Psibane item power fully scripted. Psychokinetic item power fully scripted. Psychokinetic Burst item power fully scripted. Collision is fully scripted. Parrying is fully scripted.</li>

<li>ShadowChemosh Equipment (ShadowChemosh) - In some rare cases a weapon penalty was being applied to the Touch/Ranged attack weapons when it should not have been. Added the Helper.Static tag that tells HL to ignore these weapons that are not real weapons.</li>

This adjustment is different than the official "Size Category" adjustment in that it does NOT change your gear size. Meaning you can use it to make a small or large sized human or other races.</li>

<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Redo of some of the community editor tabs to make use of the new Group editor tab logic. I combined the different PoW Disciplines Selection Helpers and Spell Schools into a new component set. This merges all the logic into a single Thing and allows for a new editor tab to define new Disciplines. I deprecated the old Discipline Spell-Schools and merged all its logic into the new PWDisc component. I added logic in PWDisc to use linkage to link to the Disciplines class skill or skills.  Up to 5 different skills can be selected. I changed Ultimate Psionics & Path of War skills to be "Unique" so that the linkages would work. Changed new Discipline tab to have it ignore non-helpful skills in the linkage.</li>
<li>Path of War Extended (ShadowChemosh) - Modified the PWManList to be able to use ArchCntAs tag group so that it can change itself to either class. Updated the Editor tab for Man Lists to be able to assign these tags. Cleaned up some of the XML. Updated a Class ability to not hard-code the reference to cHelpRog.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments PFS (ShadowChemosh) - Created a new procedure (S2PFSName) to centralize all the logic for adding additional text to for the PFS Boons.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Redo of some of the community editor tabs to make use of the new Group editor tab logic. This is helpful for the new PoW editor tabs added in the 3PP Pack.</li>
