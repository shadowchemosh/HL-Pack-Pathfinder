<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>

<strong>v1.5 November 25, 2016</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>

<li>Gallery of Evil module (ShadowChemosh) - Added in the missing "Numerian Leaf Armor" item that has slightly different rules than the Pathfinder version of Leaf armor.</li>
<li>Path of War Expanded (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #68. When using the Hidden Blade archetype and a normal Rogue (ie not Unchained Rogue) HL would toss an error.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #73. Fixed item powers Parrying, Floating & Quickness to correctly check for if they are equipped or not. This will also prevent the error message from appearing for these item powers.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Classes (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #64. Adjusted "Superstition" rage power logic based on LW changes to the core Superstition rage power. The bonus will no longer be doubled.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Issue #63. Wild Talent feat and Unlocked Talent feat where not getting Power Points and powers to print on the character sheet. Sent email to LW with question about how to cause Powers/Power Points to appear on printed character sheet. As a work around for now I have added logic that will cause the "Wild Talent" feat to display a number/day tracker to the printed character sheet only to represent the characters total power points. In addition the unlocked talent will modify the first non-manifester class it finds when "printing". This allows the information to get to the printed character sheet. Those not printing characters sheets should see no difference.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Issue #57. Psionic Archetypes that switch the manifester ability score are getting the ability score instead of modifier added to the DC of Powers. I have reported this bug to LW and hopefully it is fixed. This was reported with the Dread class using the Fearmonger archetype. LW ticket number 110317.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #16 Prc Psychic Fist. The Psychic Fist PrC now allows a selection of either manifesting powers or increasing your existing manifesting class. Blah it took WAY too many hours to get this to work correctly... =(</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #9. Aegis Aberrant Archetype was giving incorrect natural armor bonus as the character levels. The max at level 20 is now +5.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #12. The following archetypes would prevent adding disciplines after removing them: Warlord: Vanguard Commander; Warlord: Steelfist Commando; Warder: Dervish Defender.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Updated the Advanced Study feat to note that it does not currently allow for selecting a discipline outside your allowed ones. Just didn't have the extra time required to fully fix this issue.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Adjustment "Race, Size Category" was not source marked to the community.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (delawless) - Added new Dual Disciple archetype for the Psion class.</li>
<li>Warpriest Archetypes Unchained (ShadowChemosh) - Added a new "Sacred Fist Unchained" archetype for the Warpriest.  This archetype uses the Unchained Monk Flurry of Blow rules instead of the normal chained monk FoB rules.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - For concentration skills added the situational note for the the elven ART Arcane Focus. For concentration:magus skill added situational notes about Spell Combat.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Added new Conferred Adjustment called "Magus: Spell Combat". When added will have a new In-Play option appear that lets you you set the penalty to attack and turn on/off Spell Combat.  When on the correct Concentration bonus will be calculated, attack penalty applied if you set the counter, and will also correctly adjust the the Attack Values for a Weapon and the "Touch Attack" weapon when set as TWF on the Weapon tab.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Issue #71. Added new adjustment "Race, Custom Ability". That will add a generic racial ability to a creature and let you give it a unique name and a description text up to 100 characters.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Implemented Request #72. Added new "Awaken (Vermin)" spell adjustment designed to allow the awakening of a vermin. This version of Awaken opens up the Int ability score and sets it to a value of 1.  This is often requested because of the "Vermin Heart" feat. This is not allowed for PFS.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Made most Eberron tag groups to be Dynanmic in the .1st file. This allows home editors to add new tags without needing to modify the .1st file which is bad.  As the .1st file gets overwritten each update and any modifications would get lost.</li>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Added a place holder for Mark of Death.  I didn't add any abilities but left the frame work in place allowing GM's to easily add in the abilities if they wish for home games.</li>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Changed the Custom Expression on "Least Dragonmark" to NOT use Thingid.? tags and instead use Dragonmark.Tab to include the Marks. This allows an easier way for someone to add in New marks if they wish.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Found lots of left over "debug" statements in the files.  Removed them as they just cause unneeded overhead.</li>

<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Because of more advanced requirements and issues we should not be using Pick Req's to do any feat Pre-Req. I have started to change feats over to use the #hasfeat[] macro.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Replaced all "User" timings (Pre-Level, Post-Level, Post-Attributes, Pre-Attributes, First, and Final) with normal timings. LW is going to be deprecating all the "User" timing Phases in a future update. These "User" phases serve no useful purpose and should not be used.</li>

<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Redo of some of the community editor tabs to make use of the new Group editor tab logic. I combined the different PoW Disciplines Selection Helpers and Spell Schools into a new component set. This merges all the logic into a single Thing and allows for a new editor tab to define new Disciplines. I deprecated the old Discipline Spell-Schools and merged all its logic into the new PWDisc component. I added logic in PWDisc to use linkage to link to the Disciplines class skill or skills.  Up to 5 different skills can be selected. I changed Ultimate Psionics & Path of War skills to be "Unique" so that the linkages would work. Changed new Discipline tab to have it ignore non-helpful skills in the linkage.</li>
<li>Path of War Extended (ShadowChemosh) - Modified the PWManList to be able to use ArchCntAs tag group so that it can change itself to either class. Updated the Editor tab for Man Lists to be able to assign these tags. Cleaned up some of the XML. Updated a Class ability to not hard-code the reference to cHelpRog.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments PFS (ShadowChemosh) - Created a new procedure (S2PFSName) to centralize all the logic for adding additional text to for the PFS Boons.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Redo of some of the community editor tabs to make use of the new Group editor tab logic. This is helpful for the new PoW editor tabs added in the 3PP Pack.</li>
