<strong>v1.6 January 2, 2017</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #15. Aberrant archetype for Aegis class was not activating customization's when "Transformed". Customization and base Aegis DR will now get activated correctly when the "Transformed" option is checked on the In-Play tab.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #20. Commander Archetype for Tactician class has been fixed. This includes adding missing class features, removing class abilities and adding the feat "Forced Participant" for free.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #22. Elan Favored Class Options where not setup correctly and not displaying as choices. Found this for several races and fixed them all. More of the Favored Class Options that where in the files will now display and be usable. Note: That this does not mean ALL races as of yet have Favored Class Options.</li>
<li>Path of War Expanded (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #76. The Stalker archetype "Vigilante" was not changing class specials over to use Int instead of Wis.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #77. Fighters' Blade feat was not giving up to 4 levels to the Blade Skill pre-req check when it should have been.</li>
<li>RGG's Krazy Gragnar's Black Market Magic Items (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #79. Items will no longer throw errors. Fixed the Slave Collar to not throw errors and be fully functional. Added a note to the items with no scripts that they have not been fully implemented yet.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Created two new "Dossiers" (ie Character Sheets) that will appear when you print your character from inside of HL. These only display for characters that can initiate maneuvers. The first sheet "(Community) Path of War Maneuvers - Summary" Prints a summary of each maneuver or stance your character has. The second sheet "(Community) Path of War Maneuvers - Description" Prints the full text in a two column layout of each maneuver and stance your character has.</li>
<li>RGG Talented Monk (ShadowChemosh) - Added more of the class. Still more to do. Sorry not yet complete. =(</li>
<li>Path of War Adjustment (ShadowChemosh) - Added new "Initiator Class Attribute" adjustment that allows for switching which attribute is used by a Path of War Class to initiate maneuvers.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Added new adjustment "Two-Weapon Fighting Penalties" allows for lowering the standard TWF penalties of -2 down to -1 or 0.</li>
<li>Eberron (ShadowChemosh) - Add book/page number to classes and PrCs from Eberron Campaign Setting.</li>
<li>Races of Eberron (ShadowChemosh) - Added new archetype "Changeling Wizard".</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments Conferred (ShadowChemosh) - Redo of the "Overhand/Backswing" adjustment. The dropdown has a dropdown to set the display values to Desktop or iPad. The In-Play tab now has separate activation for Overhand Chop and Backswing.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Path of War maneuvers now get the ClsCountAs.? tag from the configurable allowing scripts to know which Class is associated with each Maneuver or Stance. Misc adjustments to PoW Components to allow for dossier/sheet logic.</li>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Added new tag logic of Helper.SklBonFt to the "Negotiator" feat so that new feats from Path of the Righteous work correctly.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Added new tags and updated the PUPreReqs procedure to add the four extra levels only for blade skills.</li>
</ul>


<strong>v1.5 November 25, 2016</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed text on "Initiator Level" to be correct.</li>
<li>Gallery of Evil module (ShadowChemosh) - Added in the missing "Numerian Leaf Armor" item that has slightly different rules than the Pathfinder version of Leaf armor.</li>
<li>Path of War Expanded (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #68. When using the Hidden Blade archetype and a normal Rogue (ie not Unchained Rogue) HL would toss an error.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #73. Fixed item powers Parrying, Floating & Quickness to correctly check for if they are equipped or not. This will also prevent the error message from appearing for these item powers.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Classes (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #64. Adjusted "Superstition" rage power logic based on LW changes to the core Superstition rage power. The bonus will no longer be doubled.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Issue #63. Wild Talent feat and Unlocked Talent feat where not getting Power Points and powers to print on the character sheet. Sent email to LW with question about how to cause Powers/Power Points to appear on printed character sheet. As a work around for now I have added logic that will cause the "Wild Talent" feat to display a number/day tracker to the printed character sheet only to represent the characters total power points. In addition the unlocked talent will modify the first non-manifester class it finds when "printing". This allows the information to get to the printed character sheet. Those not printing characters sheets should see no difference.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Issue #57. Psionic Archetypes that switch the manifester ability score are getting the ability score instead of modifier added to the DC of Powers. I have reported this bug to LW and hopefully it is fixed. This was reported with the Dread class using the Fearmonger archetype. LW ticket number 110317.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #16 Prc Psychic Fist. The Psychic Fist PrC now allows a selection of either manifesting powers or increasing your existing manifesting class. Blah it took WAY too many hours to get this to work correctly... =(</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #9. Aegis Aberrant Archetype was giving incorrect natural armor bonus as the character levels. The max at level 20 is now +5.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #12. The following archetypes would prevent adding disciplines after removing them: Warlord: Vanguard Commander; Warlord: Steelfist Commando; Warder: Dervish Defender.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Updated the Advanced Study feat to note that it does not currently allow for selecting a discipline outside your allowed ones. Just didn't have the extra time required to fully fix this issue.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Adjustment "Race, Size Category" was not source marked to the community.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (delawless) - Added new Dual Disciple archetype for the Psion class.</li>
<li>Warpriest Archetypes Unchained (ShadowChemosh) - Added a new "Sacred Fist Unchained" archetype for the Warpriest.  This archetype uses the Unchained Monk Flurry of Blow rules instead of the normal chained monk FoB rules.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - For concentration skills added the situational note for the the elven ART Arcane Focus. For concentration:magus skill added situational notes about Spell Combat.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Added new Conferred Adjustment called "Magus: Spell Combat". When added will have a new In-Play option appear that lets you you set the penalty to attack and turn on/off Spell Combat.  When on the correct Concentration bonus will be calculated, attack penalty applied if you set the counter, and will also correctly adjust the the Attack Values for a Weapon and the "Touch Attack" weapon when set as TWF on the Weapon tab.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Issue #71. Added new adjustment "Race, Custom Ability". That will add a generic racial ability to a creature and let you give it a unique name and a description text up to 100 characters.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Implemented Request #72. Added new "Awaken (Vermin)" spell adjustment designed to allow the awakening of a vermin. This version of Awaken opens up the Int ability score and sets it to a value of 1.  This is often requested because of the "Vermin Heart" feat. This is not allowed for PFS.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Made most Eberron tag groups to be Dynanmic in the .1st file. This allows home editors to add new tags without needing to modify the .1st file which is bad.  As the .1st file gets overwritten each update and any modifications would get lost.</li>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Added a place holder for Mark of Death.  I didn't add any abilities but left the frame work in place allowing GM's to easily add in the abilities if they wish for home games.</li>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Changed the Custom Expression on "Least Dragonmark" to NOT use Thingid.? tags and instead use Dragonmark.Tab to include the Marks. This allows an easier way for someone to add in New marks if they wish.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Found lots of left over "debug" statements in the files.  Removed them as they just cause unneeded overhead.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>

</ul>

<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Redo of some of the community editor tabs to make use of the new Group editor tab logic. I combined the different PoW Disciplines Selection Helpers and Spell Schools into a new component set. This merges all the logic into a single Thing and allows for a new editor tab to define new Disciplines. I deprecated the old Discipline Spell-Schools and merged all its logic into the new PWDisc component. I added logic in PWDisc to use linkage to link to the Disciplines class skill or skills.  Up to 5 different skills can be selected. I changed Ultimate Psionics & Path of War skills to be "Unique" so that the linkages would work. Changed new Discipline tab to have it ignore non-helpful skills in the linkage.</li>
<li>Path of War Extended (ShadowChemosh) - Modified the PWManList to be able to use ArchCntAs tag group so that it can change itself to either class.
