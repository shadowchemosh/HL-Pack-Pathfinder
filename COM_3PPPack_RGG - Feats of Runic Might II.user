You can also discharge the rune as a free action to make the dispel check on any successful weapon attack. Your dispel check is 1d20 + base attack bonus against a DC of 11 + caster level of the abjuration. This otherwise functions as the targeted dispel function of dispel magic.

While you have this rune, if you successfully counterspell another spellcaster’s spell, you gain temporary hit points equal to the level of the spell you counterspelled. These temporary hit points do not stack. (If you have 4 temporary hit points and counterspell a 7th-level spell, you have a total of 7 temporary hit points.) If you successfully counterspell, you can discharge the absorption rune as a free action to also gain an additional temporary spell slot. You gain an additional spell slot of a level up to the level of the spell you counterspelled, to a maximum of a spell level two levels lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. If you are a preparation spellcaster (such as a cleric, druid, or wizard), you must take time to prepare a spell in your bonus spell slot.
