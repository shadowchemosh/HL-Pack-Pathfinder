  <thing id="cWldGhoSur" name="Ghost Surge" description="{b}Wild Surge and Psychic Enervation:{/b} The channeler draws power not from her own emotions, but from the emotions of the spirits of the dead. When a channeler invokes a wild surge, she chooses one of the following emotions – calm, desperation, fear, or rage. If the channeler manifests calm, she reduces the chance for psychic enervation for this wild surge by 5%. If the channeler manifests desperation, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to her manifester level –these hit points last five minutes or until the channeler manifests a different emotion. If the channeler manifests fear, the power she invoked the wild surge for gains a +1 bonus to its save DC. If the channeler manifests rage, the power she invoked the wild surge for gains a +2 bonus on checks made to bypass power resistance. A channeler overcome by psychic enervation is confused until the end of her next turn and loses a number of power points equal to her normal manifester level.\n\n{b}Surge Bond:{/b} You gain Negative Energy Affinity as a bonus feat. You must still meet the normal prerequisites of the feat.\n\n{b}Improved Surge Bond:{/b} At 5th level, the channeler may share ghostly emotions with allies or enemies. Whenever she invokes a wild surge, she may share the benefits of her spectral memories with one ally that she can see within 20 feet. She may also share ghostly whispers with an enemy she can see within 20 feet. If they fail a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the channeler&apos;s level + the channeler&apos;s Charisma modifier, they are confused for one round. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. Every four levels beyond 5th, the channeler may choose one additional target, enemy or ally, for this ability." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Draw power from the emotions of deathly spirits." uniqueness="useronce">
