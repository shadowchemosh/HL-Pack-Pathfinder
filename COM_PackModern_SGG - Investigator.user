At each level, he may add one craft category to his list. Thus a 5th level inventor with an Int of 18 has an Invent check of +14, and may use it for five crafts.\n\nWhen using the Invent check to craft objects, an inventor work much faster than most crafters, but also with more waste. The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing spells is suitable for inventing. \n\nInventing an item requires 1 hour of work per 125 gp in the item&apos;s base price (or fraction thereof ), with a minimum of at least 1 hour. The character must spend the gold at the beginning of the construction process. This process can be accelerated to 1 hour of work per 250 gp in the item&apos;s base price (or fraction thereof ) by increasing the DC to create the item by 5.\n\nThe inventor can work for up to 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day, but the days need not be consecutive, and the inventor can use the rest of his time as he sees fit. If the inventor is out adventuring, he can be considered to manage 2 hours each day to item creation. \n\nThis time is not spent in one continuous period, but rather during lunch, morning preparation, and during watches at night. If other time is dedicated to creation, it must be spent in uninterrupted 1-hour blocks.\n\nThe inventor can craft any item that could be created with the Craft skill corresponding to the categories he has selected, though he must have appropriate raw materials and tools to do so." compset="CustomSpec" uniqueness="useronce">
