      July 17, 2012 - Tim Shadow
      -Added in "pFlurryWea" adjustment from "PFRPG_Monk_FoB.user" and renamed to pJHFlurryW for now. This seems required for this file to work. But the Flurry of Blows addon makes too many crazy adjustments to be added at this time to such a popular downloaded data set.
      -Removed Childlives test for fPiranStr feat.

      Feb 21, 2012 - Jeff Hersh
      Put together various racial abilities to copy a monk's class abilities. This is for creatures that have monk class abilities but do not have monk levels.]]></info_history>

A monk may substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows.
