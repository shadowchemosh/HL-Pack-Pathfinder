This effect acts as a {i}create water{/i} spell cast at your character level (so any effect or magic that would prevent create water, also prevents this feat from functioning). The water within this area can be affected by control water normally." compset="Feat" summary="You can summon up water into the spaces you magically create." uniqueness="useronce">

First, you can raise and lower the water multiple times as a move action each time (even switching between the two versions of the spell during one casting). Second, as a standard action you can attempt to make a combat maneuver against anything in the water, as long as it is smaller than the volume of the water you are controlling. Your CMB for these checks is equal to your caster level plus your ability modifier for the ability that grants you bonus spells per day. Unless you have the appropriate improved maneuver feat, such maneuvers do provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures that threaten you." compset="Feat" summary="Your ability to control water is greatly expanded." uniqueness="useronce">

The water elemental cannot leave the area of the water you control, and you may only have one water elemental active at a time." compset="Feat" summary="You have become a duke of the element of water." uniqueness="useronce">

You add half your caster level to Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made against creatures with the water subtype.

  <thing id="fSGWtrLife" name="Water of Life" description="Your water spells are also blood magic. \n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (religion) 1 rank, ability to cast {i}control water{/i}.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: You can control and create blood with spells designed to control or create water. You can use create water or create food and water to create enough blood to feed one Medium bloodsucking creature per four caster levels. You can treat all creatures with blood as if they were water-based creatures when casting the lower water version of create water. When you cast the raise water version of control water, any creature in the area with blood and an injury gains a 2d6 bleed (Fort negates). If you happen to come across pools of blood at least 1 inch deep, you can raise and lower them using the control water spell. \n\nAlso any time you cast a spell that creates or summons water (such as aqueous orb), you may have it instead create or summon blood. This first time each day living creatures see you do this, they must make a Will save (DC as a spell of the level used to create blood) or be shaken for 1 round." compset="Feat" summary="Your water spells are also blood magic." uniqueness="useronce">
