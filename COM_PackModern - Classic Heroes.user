An Engineer may take 10 or take 20 on this check. \n\nThe reconfiguration imposes a -1 penalty on attack rolls made with the weapon but grants one of the following benefits indefinitely:\n \nChanged Rate of Fire: The reconfiguration changes the weapon&apos;s rate of fire. A semiautomatic-only weapon switches to an automatic-only weapon, or vice versa. This benefit applies only to a ranged weapon with either a semiautomatic or automatic fire setting. \n\nGreater Ammo Capacity: The reconfigured weapon can hold 50% more ammunition than normal. This benefit applies only to weapons that take ammunition. \n\nGreater Concealment: The reconfiguration grants a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal the reconfigured weapon. \n\nGreater Range Increment: The reconfigured weapon&apos;s range increment increases by 10 feet. This benefit applies only to weapons with range increments. \n\nSignature Shooter: The weapon is reconfigured for a single individual&apos;s use only and is treated as a unique exotic weapon. Anyone else who uses the weapon takes a -4 non-proficient penalty on attack rolls. \n\nWeapons can be reconfigured multiple times; each time a weapon is reconfigured, it imparts a new benefit.

If the target fails, he or she reacts to the emotion as described below. \n\nDespair: The target takes a -2 morale penalty on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. \nHope: The target gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. \nRage: The target gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -1 penalty to Armor Class. In a dramatic situation, the target is compelled to fight, regardless of the danger. \n\nThis ability replaces Versatile performance." compset="ClSpecial">

It has a range of 30 feet and lasts as long as the Slayer concentrates, up to a number of rounds equal to the Slayer&apos;s level. \n\nThe amount of information gleaned by this uncanny awareness depends on how long the Slayer focuses his attention. \n\n1st Round: Presence or absence of Shadow creatures. \n\n2nd Round: Number of Shadow auras (creatures or objects of Shadow) in the area and the power of the strongest Shadow aura present. If the power of the strongest Shadow aura is &quot;overwhelming,&quot; and has a rating of at least twice the Shadow Slayer&apos;s level, the Slayer is stunned for 1 round and the use of this ability ends. While stunned, the Slayer can&apos;t act, he loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and attackers gain a +2 bonus on attacks made against him. \n\n3rd Round: The power of each Shadow aura in the area becomes clear. If an aura is outside the Slayer&apos;s line of sight, then he discerns its direction but not its exact location. \n\nShadow Aura: A creature of Shadow emanates an aura that links it to the supernatural dimension.

The GM secretly rolls percentile dice; there is a 70% +1% per character level chance of getting a response on the hunch (failure indicates merely that you are unsure if this is true or not). \n\nIf the roll is a success, the player knows if the hunch is true, false, both or neither. A &quot;both&quot; response is possible for vague assumptions. An &quot;unknown&quot; response is for questions with no immediate answer. \n\nIt may be determined that a hunch is so obvious that it does not require a roll, or that it is so vague that there is no chance for success. In these cases, the Hero Point is not spent (though the attempt still counts as a full-round action). A hunch does not translate as a legal truth, and will not stand up in a court of law.

A psionic aura is given off by any active or permanent power, or during the use of any psionic feat. Characters who have levels in a psionic class, creatures with the psionic subtype, and creatures with the Wild Talent feat possess psionic auras. The amount of information revealed by the manifestation of this power depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\n\n1st Round: Presence or absence of psionic auras.\n\n2nd Round: Number of different psionic auras and the strength of the most potent aura.\n\n3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (Psionics) checks to determine the discipline involved in each aura. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + power level, or 15 + one-half manifester level for an effect that is not created by a power, such as that of a psionic item.) If the aura emanates from a psionic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\n\nPsionically charged locations, multiple disciplines, or strong local psionic emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.\n\nAura Strength: A psionic aura’s strength depends on a functioning power’s level or an item’s manifester level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect Psionics indicates the stronger of the two. Detection of an overwhelming aura (see the accompanying table) dazes you for 1 round and the power ends.\n\nPower or Item                                                                                               Aura Strength   \n                                                                                          Faint              Moderate       Strong          Overwhelming \nFunctioning power (power level)                       3rd or lower         4th-6th         7th-9th         10th+ (deity-level) \nPsionic item or creature (manifester level)    5th or lower        6th-11th     12th-20th       21st+ (artifact) \n\nLingering Aura: A psionic aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a power) or is destroyed (in the case of a psionic item). If detect Psionics is manifested and directed at such a location, the power indicates an aura of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original strength:\n\nOriginal Strength    Duration \nFaint                          1d6 minutes \nModerate                 1d6 x 10 minutes \nStrong                       1d6 hours \nOverwhelming        1d6 days \n\nEach round, you can turn to detect Psionics in a new area. You can tell the difference between magical and psionic auras.\n\nThe power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.\n\nAugment This power may be augmented in the following way.\n\n\nAugment: If you add 2 additional DC points, the duration changes to 3 rounds/lvl. (D) (no concentration required) and it also gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This power does not allow you to identify artifacts.\n\nConcentration Check DC Modifier +1 per use\n\nFailed Check:  The manifester becomes fatigued for 1d4 rounds." compset="RaceCustom" summary="You detect the presence of psionics.">

A negated power ends as if its duration had expired. Negate psychic ability can negate (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as psychic c powers. Negate psychic ability affects spell-like abilities just as it affects powers (and spells). A manifester can’t use negate psionics to undo the effects of any power with instantaneous duration. \n\nThe manifester chooses to use negate psychic ability in one of two ways: a targeted negation or an area negation: \n\nTargeted Negation: One object, creature, or power is the target of the power. The manifester makes a negation check against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. A negation check is 1d20 + 1 per manifester level against a DC of 11 + the manifester level of the power to be negated. \n\nIf the object that targeted is a psionic item, the manifester makes a negation check against the item’s manifester level. If the manifester succeeds, all the item’s psychic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsychic for the duration of the effect. \n\nThe manifester automatically succeed on the negation check against any power that he or she manifested his or herself. \n\nArea Negation: The power affects everything within a 30-foot radius. \n\nFor each creature that is the target of one or more powers, the manifester makes a negation check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that fails, he or she makes negation checks against progressively weaker powers until he or she negates one power (which discharges the negate psychic  ability so far as that target is concerned) or fails all his or her checks. The creature’s psychic items are not affected. \n\nFor each object that is the target of one or more powers, the manifester makes negation checks as with creatures. Psychic  items are not affected by area negations. \n\nFor each ongoing power with an area centered within the negate psychic ability target area, the manifester makes a negation check to negate the power. \n\nFor each ongoing power whose area overlaps with that of the negation, the manifester makes a negation check to end the effect, but only within the area of the negate psychic ability." compset="RaceCustom" summary="Negate psychic ability can be used to end ongoing powers" uniqueness="unique">

A negated power ends as if its duration had expired. Negate psychic ability can negate (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as psychic c powers. Negate psychic ability affects spell-like abilities just as it affects powers (and spells). A manifester can’t use negate psionics to undo the effects of any power with instantaneous duration. \n\nThe manifester chooses to use negate psychic ability in one of two ways: a targeted negation or an area negation: \n\nTargeted Negation: One object, creature, or power is the target of the power. The manifester makes a negation check against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. A negation check is 1d20 + 1 per manifester level against a DC of 11 + the manifester level of the power to be negated. \n\nIf the object that targeted is a psionic item, the manifester makes a negation check against the item’s manifester level. If the manifester succeeds, all the item’s psychic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsychic for the duration of the effect. \n\nThe manifester automatically succeed on the negation check against any power that he or she manifested his or herself. \n\nArea Negation: The power affects everything within a 30-foot radius. \n\nFor each creature that is the target of one or more powers, the manifester makes a negation check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that fails, he or she makes negation checks against progressively weaker powers until he or she negates one power (which discharges the negate psychic  ability so far as that target is concerned) or fails all his or her checks. The creature’s psychic items are not affected. \n\nFor each object that is the target of one or more powers, the manifester makes negation checks as with creatures. Psychic  items are not affected by area negations. \n\nFor each ongoing power with an area centered within the negate psychic ability target area, the manifester makes a negation check to negate the power. \n\nFor each ongoing power whose area overlaps with that of the negation, the manifester makes a negation check to end the effect, but only within the area of the negate psychic ability." compset="RaceCustom" summary="Negate psychic ability can be used to end ongoing powers" uniqueness="unique">

Detection of an overwhelming aura (see the accompanying table) dazes you for 1 round and the power ends.\n\nPower or Item                                                                                               Aura Strength   \n                                                                                          Faint              Moderate       Strong          Overwhelming \nFunctioning power (power level)                       3rd or lower         4th-6th         7th-9th         10th+ (deity-level) \nPsionic item or creature (manifester level)    5th or lower        6th-11th     12th-20th       21st+ (artifact) \n\nLingering Aura: A psionic aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a power) or is destroyed (in the case of a psionic item). If detect Psionics is manifested and directed at such a location, the power indicates an aura of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original strength:\n\nOriginal Strength    Duration \nFaint                          1d6 minutes \nModerate                 1d6 x 10 minutes \nStrong                       1d6 hours \nOverwhelming        1d6 days \n\nEach round, you can turn to detect Psionics in a new area. You can tell the difference between magical and psionic auras.\n\nThe power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.\n\nAugment This power may be augmented in the following way.\n\n\nAugment: If you add 2 additional DC points, the duration changes to 3 rounds/lvl. (D) (no concentration required) and it also gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This power does not allow you to identify artifacts.\n\nConcentration Check DC Modifier +1 per use\n\nFailed Check:  The manifester becomes fatigued for 1d4 rounds." compset="RaceCustom" summary="You detect the presence of psionics.">

  <thing id="rcMPATDPAu" name="Detect Psionics" description="Display Auditory and visual\nManifesting Time 1 standard action\nRange 60 ft.\nArea Cone-shaped emanation centered on you\nDuration Concentration, up to 1 min./level \nSaving Throw None\nPower Resistance No\n\nYou detect psionic auras. A psionic aura is given off by any active or permanent power, or during the use of any psionic feat. Characters who have levels in a psionic class, creatures with the psionic subtype, and creatures with the Wild Talent feat possess psionic auras. The amount of information revealed by the manifestation of this power depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\n\n1st Round: Presence or absence of psionic auras.\n\n2nd Round: Number of different psionic auras and the strength of the most potent aura.\n\n3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (Psionics) checks to determine the discipline involved in each aura. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + power level, or 15 + one-half manifester level for an effect that is not created by a power, such as that of a psionic item.) If the aura emanates from a psionic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).\n\nPsionically charged locations, multiple disciplines, or strong local psionic emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.\n\nAura Strength: A psionic aura’s strength depends on a functioning power’s level or an item’s manifester level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect Psionics indicates the stronger of the two. Detection of an overwhelming aura (see the accompanying table) dazes you for 1 round and the power ends.\n\nPower or Item                                                                                               Aura Strength   \n                                                                                          Faint              Moderate       Strong          Overwhelming \nFunctioning power (power level)                       3rd or lower         4th-6th         7th-9th         10th+ (deity-level) \nPsionic item or creature (manifester level)    5th or lower        6th-11th     12th-20th       21st+ (artifact) \n\nLingering Aura: A psionic aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a power) or is destroyed (in the case of a psionic item). If detect Psionics is manifested and directed at such a location, the power indicates an aura of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original strength:\n\nOriginal Strength    Duration \nFaint                          1d6 minutes \nModerate                 1d6 x 10 minutes \nStrong                       1d6 hours \nOverwhelming        1d6 days \n\nEach round, you can turn to detect Psionics in a new area. You can tell the difference between magical and psionic auras.\n\nThe power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.\n\nAugment This power may be augmented in the following way.\n\n\nAugment: If you add 2 additional DC points, the duration changes to 3 rounds/lvl. (D) (no concentration required) and it also gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This power does not allow you to identify artifacts.\n\nConcentration Check DC Modifier +1 per use\n\nFailed Check:  The manifester becomes fatigued for 1d4 rounds." compset="RaceCustom" summary="You detect the presence of psionics.">

Upon hitting its target, this ectoplasmic grapnel reels in, pulling the target to you - or you to it.\n\nWhen manifesting this power, you must have a hand free, and must make a ranged touch attack against the target; a miss causes the grapnel to retract instantly without attaching to anything. Alternately, you may have it shoot out from your shield instead of a free hand; you still get your shield&apos;s AC bonus against the target, but lose it against anyone else for the duration of the power.\n\nIf you target a creature no more than one size category larger than you, you may attempt a drag combat maneuver check. If successful, you move the creature 5 feet closer to you. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent&apos;s CMD, you can drag the target an additional 5 feet toward you. If the creature is willing, you may drag it up to 30 feet closer to you.\n\nIf you target an unattended object, you may pull it up to 30 feet towards you; if this moves it into your square, you may grasp the item immediately as a free action, although you must have a free hand to do so. If you target an attended object, the ranged touch attack is made against the opponent, and you must succeed at a disarm or steal (your choice) combat maneuver check to wrest the item free.\n\nIf you fail at the combat maneuver check (or if you target an immovable object such as a creature more than one size category larger than you, an object bolted to the floor, or a building wall, floor, or ceiling), you are instead moved up to 30 feet towards the target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternately, you may choose to relinquish your grip on the ectoplasmic cord, knocking you prone and ending the power immediately rather than moving you towards the target. If you end your movement at a climbable location (such as a wall or ledge), you must attempt a Climb check (at normal DC) to grab hold (or pull yourself over the edge, in the case of a ledge); failure means you begin falling, and must make a second Climb check with +20 DC to catch yourself.\n\nIf you spend a full-round action bracing yourself before manifesting this power, you get a +2 bonus on the above combat maneuver checks. Each adjacent ally that spends an Aid Another action to grab hold of you also adds a +2 bonus to your combat maneuver check, but also suffers the consequence of being dragged or knocked prone with you should the check fail. If the power duration should be extended beyond instantaneous (see augment below), each ally holding onto you must spend an Aid Another action each turn to maintain their hold. If you end your movement at a climbable location, each ally may make a Climb check to grab the wall, or may instead continue holding onto you; your own Climb check is penalized as normal if their combined weight drops your encumbrance into a category with a worse armor check penalty.\n\nIf you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are in control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check; failure means you are no longer grappling the creature, while success means you gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver check for each creature (besides yourself) participating in the grapple. If the drag combat maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged (or knocked prone) accordingly.\n\nIf you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are not in control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check; success means you have broken free of the grapple, while failure means you are still grappling (but gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver check for each creature (besides yourself) participating in the grapple). If the drag combat maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged (or knocked prone) accordingly, unless the creature grappling you is too large for you to drag (in which case the cord snaps and the power fails). The grappling creature may voluntarily release you from the grapple to avoid being dragged or knocked prone, but must do so before the combat maneuver check is rolled.\n\nAugment: You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways:\n\n1. If you spend 2 additional Psi Points, the duration increases to 1 rnd./lvl. if the ranged touch attack hits. The cord does not automatically retract; you may choose to retract or extend the cord up to 30 feet (to the limit of the power&apos;s range) as a standard action, and must succeed at a combat maneuver check each time you attempt to drag an unwilling creature in this manner. Other creatures may climb or manipulate the cord as they would a rope, but it is as strong as a chain. An unwilling creature attached to the grapnel must cut (5 hp, hardness 10, AC 10) or burst (Str DC 26) the cord to move away from you, unless he succeeds at a drag combat maneuver check to pull you behind him. If the cord is cut or burst, or if you let go of the cord (a free action), the power ends immediately.\n\n2. If you spend 2 additional Psi Points, the range of the power increases to Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./lvl.).\n\n3. If you spend 4 additional Psi Points, the cord retracts the full length instantly. A successful combat maneuver check, by any margin, pulls the target adjacent to you, while a failed combat maneuver check pulls you adjacent to the target (unless you relinquish the cord and go prone instead).\n\n4. For every 4 additional Psi Points you spend, this power can drag creatures an additional size category larger than you, and the cord&apos;s hardness increases by 2, hit points increases by 10, and break DC increases by 2.\n\n5. If you spend 4 additional Psi Points, you can manifest this power as a move action.\n\nIn addition, for every 2 additional Psi Points you spend to achieve any of these effects, you also gain a +1 bonus on any combat maneuver checks or Climb checks you make for this power." compset="RaceCustom" summary="Use a ray of ectoplasm to perform a variety of functions." uniqueness="unique">

Example class features include Evasion and Improved Evasion, Still Mind, Divine Grace, and Slippery Mind. The GM may allow additional abilities at his discretion. You may effectively grant this class feature to any or all willing targets of your choice; treat them as if they actually had the class feature in question, with one exception: if a class feature has additional benefits besides directly modifying the saving throw (such as fear immunity from Aura of Courage), then they are not included.\n\nIn addition, for every 2 Psi Points spent to achieve either of these effects, the save DC increases by 1." compset="RaceCustom" summary="You and another share the use of the best saving throws between you." uniqueness="unique">

So long as the stunt can be succinctly described in ten words or less, it occurs, no matter how unlikely this is. This trick shot has no influence on attack or damage rolls, although the effect itself may allow an attack to occur. Example trick shots include the following (which are descriptive and of varying complexity; the sentences used in manifesting are shorter): - Shooting an arrow through the sockets of twelve axe heads between you and your target - Bouncing a billiard ball off of nine different fixtures (including your friend&apos;s breastplate) before sinking in a pocket - Having a crossbow bolt “loop the loop” before impacting normally - Forcing a tossed coin to land, perfectly stable, on its edge - Getting a javelin to slalom around trees between you and your target - Directing the tiny bead of an undetonated fireball to fly a “figure eight” around its target&apos;s feet - Allowing a dagger, despite being pointy, to bounce off of the ground between a creature&apos;s legs and continue unhindered to its actual target behind him\n\nFrom a combat perspective, the most powerful use of this power would be to shoot around corners, but doing so is treated as shooting blind.

When astral travelers begin their journey, each one is connected to the Material Plane by an insubstantial silvery cord. Very few weapons exist that can damage a silvery cord. The last creature in the line of those making up the caravan is sometimes referred to as the rear guard, because he or she has one hand free and can use it to wield a weapon without relinquishing his or her grip on the next traveler in line. The weightless, subjective environment of the Astral Plane allows the caravan to flex and bend as necessary to bring the rear guard’s weapon to bear." compset="RaceCustom" summary="Enable yourself or another to join an astral caravan-enabled trip." uniqueness="unique">

Ammunition created this way is considered masterwork (+1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, no direct bonus on damage rolls). Ephemeral ammunition has a delayed-delivery effect: After being fired, the bolt partially phases out of the material plane and onto the ethereal plane. This does not allow it to shoot through armor or walls (you still need clear line of effect to your target), but it does allow it to impact a target without the target noticing. A bolt that successfully hits a corporeal target embeds itself entirely in the target, but the effect is not obvious -- the bolt does no damage, and there&apos;s no entry wound. You may only have one active ephemeral bolt effect at any time and you must overcome any applicable Power Resistance for the delayed-delivery aspect of this power to function.\n\nAt any point during the power&apos;s duration, as a swift action, you may order the ammunition to return to the material plane, at which point it delivers its full normal damage (adjusted for damage reduction if appropriate) +1d4 points of force damage before dissipating back to its constituent ectoplasmic particles. No external wounds are present from this damage. This power is frequently used to deliver poison as well as its usual effects; such additions to the ammunition take effect when damage is dealt.\n\nAs a side property of the phasing effect, ephemeral bolts can be used to attack ethereal creatures while you stand on the material plane, although they are treated as invisible unless you can see them through other means. Used this way, the bolts lose their delayed-delivery property and are treated as normal (although they retain the bonus force damage), and any obstruction on either plane stops them. As a side property of the phasing effect, ephemeral bolts can be used to attack ethereal creatures while you are on the material plane or to attack material creatures while you are on the ethereal plane, although the bolts and ethereal creatures are treated as invisible unless one can see ethereal objects. Used this way, the bolts lose their delayed-delivery property and are treated as normal (although they retain the bonus force damage), and any obstruction on either plane stops them.\n\nIf used to attack an incorporeal target (on either plane), the bolts do 1d4 points of force damage on impact.\n\nAugment You may augment this power in one or both of the following ways:\n\n1. For every 4 additional Psi Points you spend, increase the force damage dealt by each bolt by one die (d4), and increase the enhancement bonus on attack rolls by 1.\n\n2. If you spend 3 additional Psi Points, the enhancement bonus on attack rolls applies to damage rolls as well.\n\n3. For every 4 additional Psi Points you spend, you can create an additional bolt, arrow, or sling bullet.

  <thing id="rcMPDPLcWs" name="2 - Localized Windstorm" description="Display: Auditory\nManifesting Time: 1 standard action\nRange: close (25 ft. +5 ft/lvl.)\nEffect: Wall up to 10 ft./lvl. long and 5 ft./lvl. high (S)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 rnd./lvl.\nSaving Throw: None, see text\nPower Resistance: Yes\nPsi Points: 3 \n\nThrough force of will alone, you generate a small storm of psychokinetic turbulence in the air. The storm itself manifests as a wall which can intensify the existing winds in a small area, or can instead be set to exactly counter such winds, generating a peaceful area of calm. While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square walls to enclose specific points.\n\nChoose to intensify or pacify the winds when you manifest this power (although the decision can be changed when you reshape the effect, see below). Intensifying the winds creates an invisible vertical curtain of wind. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Flying creatures smaller than Medium size cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Projectiles of 1 pound or less passing through the wind wall are deflected upward and miss. For every pound above 1 of the projectile&apos;s weight, it has a 10% chance to not be blown off course. Projectiles weighing 10 lbs or more are unaffected by the wind wall. Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).\n\nPacifying the winds allows you to generate a region of calm that consists of every 5 ft. cube that shares an edge or space with where the wind wall would otherwise be. These regions are treated as if their wind conditions were two categories fairer than they would naturally be, to a minimum of no winds. Additionally, if these areas of calm overlap an existing wind wall or an intensifying localized windstorm, the two effects cancel, letting normal wind conditions prevail in the square.\n\nAt any point during the duration, you may extend your concentration to a full-round action. Doing so allows you reshape the wall into any other configuration you could have chosen when you manifest this power, including the choice to intensify or pacify.\n\nAugment You may augment this power in one or more of the following ways:\n\n1. If you spend 2 additional Psi Points, the duration increases to 1 rnd./lvl.. You no longer need to maintain concentration. You may reshape the wall by spending a standard action in concentration.\n\n2. If you spend 2 additional Psi Points, the range of this power increases to Medium (100 ft. +10 ft./lvl.).\n\n3. If you spend 2 additional Psi Points, your control over the localized windstorm increases greatly. You may reshape the wall as normal or as an immediate action. You may also generate pockets of calm interspersed with pockets of intense winds when you shape the wall (effectively, this is the intensify option except that the wall may be broken with as many 5-foot cubes of calm that you choose, as per the pacify option). 4. For every 2 additional Psi Points you spend, you can reduce the wind conditions an additional category when using the pacify option.\n\n5. For every additional Psi Point, the weight limit of projectiles that are deflected increases by 1 lb.\n\nIn addition, for every 2 Psi Points spent achieving any of these effects, increase the save DC by 1." compset="RaceCustom" summary="Increase or decrease winds in a small, controllable area." uniqueness="unique">

This ability allows you to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. With the scent ability, you can identify familiar odors just as humanoids do familiar sights.\n\nYou can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.\n\nWhen you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source’s location.\n\nYou can follow tracks by smell, making a Survival check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2.

Upon hitting its target, this ectoplasmic grapnel reels in, pulling the target to you - or you to it.\n\nWhen manifesting this power, you must have a hand free, and must make a ranged touch attack against the target; a miss causes the grapnel to retract instantly without attaching to anything. Alternately, you may have it shoot out from your shield instead of a free hand; you still get your shield&apos;s AC bonus against the target, but lose it against anyone else for the duration of the power.\n\nIf you target a creature no more than one size category larger than you, you may attempt a drag combat maneuver check. If successful, you move the creature 5 feet closer to you. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent&apos;s CMD, you can drag the target an additional 5 feet toward you. If the creature is willing, you may drag it up to 30 feet closer to you.\n\nIf you target an unattended object, you may pull it up to 30 feet towards you; if this moves it into your square, you may grasp the item immediately as a free action, although you must have a free hand to do so. If you target an attended object, the ranged touch attack is made against the opponent, and you must succeed at a disarm or steal (your choice) combat maneuver check to wrest the item free.\n\nIf you fail at the combat maneuver check (or if you target an immovable object such as a creature more than one size category larger than you, an object bolted to the floor, or a building wall, floor, or ceiling), you are instead moved up to 30 feet towards the target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternately, you may choose to relinquish your grip on the ectoplasmic cord, knocking you prone and ending the power immediately rather than moving you towards the target. If you end your movement at a climbable location (such as a wall or ledge), you must attempt a Climb check (at normal DC) to grab hold (or pull yourself over the edge, in the case of a ledge); failure means you begin falling, and must make a second Climb check with +20 DC to catch yourself.\n\nIf you spend a full-round action bracing yourself before manifesting this power, you get a +2 bonus on the above combat maneuver checks. Each adjacent ally that spends an Aid Another action to grab hold of you also adds a +2 bonus to your combat maneuver check, but also suffers the consequence of being dragged or knocked prone with you should the check fail. If the power duration should be extended beyond instantaneous (see augment below), each ally holding onto you must spend an Aid Another action each turn to maintain their hold. If you end your movement at a climbable location, each ally may make a Climb check to grab the wall, or may instead continue holding onto you; your own Climb check is penalized as normal if their combined weight drops your encumbrance into a category with a worse armor check penalty.\n\nIf you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are in control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check; failure means you are no longer grappling the creature, while success means you gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver check for each creature (besides yourself) participating in the grapple. If the drag combat maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged (or knocked prone) accordingly.\n\nIf you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are not in control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check; success means you have broken free of the grapple, while failure means you are still grappling (but gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver check for each creature (besides yourself) participating in the grapple). If the drag combat maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged (or knocked prone) accordingly, unless the creature grappling you is too large for you to drag (in which case the cord snaps and the power fails). The grappling creature may voluntarily release you from the grapple to avoid being dragged or knocked prone, but must do so before the combat maneuver check is rolled.\n\nAugment: You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways:\n\n1. If you spend 2 additional Psi Points, the duration increases to 1 rnd./lvl. if the ranged touch attack hits. The cord does not automatically retract; you may choose to retract or extend the cord up to 30 feet (to the limit of the power&apos;s range) as a standard action, and must succeed at a combat maneuver check each time you attempt to drag an unwilling creature in this manner. Other creatures may climb or manipulate the cord as they would a rope, but it is as strong as a chain. An unwilling creature attached to the grapnel must cut (5 hp, hardness 10, AC 10) or burst (Str DC 26) the cord to move away from you, unless he succeeds at a drag combat maneuver check to pull you behind him. If the cord is cut or burst, or if you let go of the cord (a free action), the power ends immediately.\n\n2. If you spend 2 additional Psi Points, the range of the power increases to Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./lvl.).\n\n3. If you spend 4 additional Psi Points, the cord retracts the full length instantly. A successful combat maneuver check, by any margin, pulls the target adjacent to you, while a failed combat maneuver check pulls you adjacent to the target (unless you relinquish the cord and go prone instead).\n\n4. For every 4 additional Psi Points you spend, this power can drag creatures an additional size category larger than you, and the cord&apos;s hardness increases by 2, hit points increases by 10, and break DC increases by 2.\n\n5. If you spend 4 additional Psi Points, you can manifest this power as a move action.\n\nIn addition, for every 2 additional Psi Points you spend to achieve any of these effects, you also gain a +1 bonus on any combat maneuver checks or Climb checks you make for this power." compset="RaceCustom" summary="Use a ray of ectoplasm to perform a variety of functions." uniqueness="unique">

You must manifest this power in response to a single attack made with a ranged weapon within medium range (the attacker must be within range, the target need not be) before the result of the attack is determined. You cannot use this power to mirror unusually massive projectiles such as siege weapons. You create four reflections of the projectile that each do damage as a mundane weapon of the original projectile&apos;s type. Each mirrored projectile uses the same attack roll result as the reflected attack to determine if they strike the target or not (regardless of their enhancement bonus to attack), and each projectile checks for concealment individually. Effects that modify the weapon or its damage, such as that from Psionic Shot or prevenom weapon, do not apply to these reflections.\n\nIf applicable, the projectiles add the Strength bonus of the original attacker under the normal constraints for the attacker&apos;s weapon (full strength bonus for thrown weapons, full strength bonus up to a certain value for composite longbows, etc). The reflections return to their native reality shortly after appearing and cannot be preserved.\n\nPrecision damage (such as sneak attack) and extra damage from critical hits only apply to the first projectile fired, not to the four reflections. The four mirrored projectiles bypass damage reduction as though they were magic weapons.\n\nAugment You may augment this power in one or more of the following ways:\n\n1. By spending additional Psi Points, you may reflect enhancement bonuses or magic abilities of the initial projectile. For every 2 additional Psi Points you spend, you may bestow the reflections with the equivalent of an additional +1 enhancement bonus or ability priced as a +1 bonus. Reflecting abilities that add a flat sum to the price of the weapon cost 1 additional Psi Point per 5000 gp of their market price to replicate. Like standard magical weapons, you may not add abilities to the reflection projectiles unless they already have at least a +1 enhancement bonus. The enhancement bonus or ability to be added must exist on the original projectile.\n\n2. For every 4 additional Psi Points you spend, you may create an additional projectile.\n\n3. If you spend 10 additional Psi Points, you may use this power to reflect unusually massive projectiles such as siege weapons or boulders hurled by giants. All reflections strike the same area, if applicable." compset="RaceCustom" summary="Reflects alternate realities, partially duplicating a projectile in midair." uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rcMPDPCnFm" name="1 - Control Flames" description="Display Auditory\nManifesting Time 1 standard action\nRange Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) Area One non-magical fire source; see text\nDuration Concentration, up to 1 min./level\nSaving Throw See text\nPower Resistance No\nPsi Points 1\n\nYou pyrokinetically control the intensity or movements of one fire source. A non-magical fire source can be controlled if it is equal to or smaller than the maximum size of fire you can control according to your manifester level, as noted on the accompanying table. You can freely switch control between fire sources, or change the nature of your control, while you maintain concentration, but only one specified change (keeping a fire burning, animating it, or altering its size) can be made to one fire source in a round. When your control over a fire source lapses, that fire immediately returns to its original state (or goes out if it has no fuel or has been moved away from its original location). With this power, you can artificially keep a fire burning that would normally expire for lack of fuel; even dousing a controlled flame with water does not put it out (though completely submerging the flame would). Normally, a creature at risk of catching on fire can avoid this fate by making a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, with success indicating that the fire has gone out. If the fire is one that has been kept burning by the use of control flames, then the DC of the Reflex save needed to put out the flames increases to 25.\n\nThis power also enables you to make a fire move as if it were a living creature. You can animate only a naturally burning fire; if you attempt to animate one that has been increased or decreased in size by your augmentation of this power, the fire immediately returns to its original size. An animated fire moves at a speed of 30 feet. A fire that moves away from its fuel or its original location dies as soon as your control over it lapses.\n\nTable: Control Flames\n\nManifester Level Fire Size Example Maximum Damage \nper Round Space \n1st-2nd Fine Tindertwig 1 1 foot square \n3rd-4th Diminutive Torch 1d3 1 foot square \n5th-6th Tiny Small campfire 1d6 1 foot square \n7th-8th Small Large campfire 2d6 1 foot square \n9th-10th Medium Forge 3d6 1 foot square \n11th-12th Large Bonfire 4d6 2-by-2-foot square \n13th-14th Huge Burning shack 5d6 3-by-3-foot square \n15th-16th Gargantuan Burning tavern 6d6 4-by-4-foot square \n17th or higher Colossal Burning inn 7d6 5-by-5-foot square \n\nAn animated fire can enter any square, even if a creature already occupies it. If an animated fire enters a square occupied by a creature, that creature can make a Reflex save to get out of the way (DC 11 + the number of dice of damage the fire does + your key ability modifier). A successful Reflex save moves the creature to the nearest unoccupied square. The flames deal the indicated damage to any creature that is either on fire or surrounded by the flames (in the fire’s space); see the accompanying table). At the start of your turn, the animated fire deals damage to any creature in its space, and the creature catches on fire unless it makes a Reflex save (DC as noted above). A victim on fire takes 1d6 points of damage each round. Additional rounds in the same space as the animated fire occupies mean additional chances of ignition. The damage from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving throw each round to negate each fire. It is possible to switch control from the animated fire (causing it to disappear) to intensify flames that are already burning (thus denying the foe Reflex saves after the first).\n\nAugment You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.\n\n1. For every 2 additional Psi Points you spend, you can increase the size of a fire you want to control by one step, up to the maximum size of fire you can control according to your manifester level.\n\n2. For every 2 additional Psi Points you spend, you can decrease the size of a fire you want to control by one step. You can reduce a Tiny or smaller fire to nothing, extinguishing it." compset="RaceCustom" summary="Take control of nearby open flame." uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="rcMPDPDsPc" name="3 - Dispel Psionics" description="Display Visual\nManifesting Time 1 standard action\nRange Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)\nTarget or Area One manifester, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst\nDuration Instantaneous\nSaving Throw None\nPower Resistance No\nPsi Points 5\n\nYou can use dispel psionics to end one ongoing power that has been manifest on a creature or object or to temporarily suppress the psionic abilities of a psionic item. A dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some Powers, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by dispel Psionics. Dispel Psionics can dispel (but not counter) psi-like effects just as it does Powers. The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already over before the dispel Psionics can take effect.\n\nTargeted Dispel\n\nOne object, creature, or power is the target of the dispel Psionics power. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level) and compare that to the power with highest manifester level (DC = 11 + the power’s manifester level). If successful, that power ends. If not, compare the same result to the power with the next highest manifester level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one power affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every power.\n\nFor example, a 7th-level manifester manifests dispel Psionics, targeting a creature affected by biofeedback (manifester level 12th) and flight (manifester level 7th). The manifester level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the biofeedback (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the flight (which only required a 18). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the biofeedback would have been dispelled, leaving the flight intact. Had the dispel check been a 17 or less, no powers would have been affected.\n\nYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one power affecting the target or one power affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific power effect to be targeted in this way. If your manifester level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that power, it ends. No other powers or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\n\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the power that conjured the object or creature.\n\nIf the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s manifester level (DC = 11 + the item’s manifester level). If you succeed, all the item’s psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its psionic properties. A suppressed item becomes nonPsionic for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A psionic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal Psionics such as this.\n\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifest yourself.\n\nAugment This power may be augmented in one of the following ways.\n1.If you spend an additional 6 Psi Points, your targeted dispel can dispel one power for every four manifester levels you possess, starting with the highest level powers and proceeding to lower level Powers. It also has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if an unaugmented dispel Psionics can’t dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse’s DC.\n2.If you spend an additional 6 Psi Points, you may choose to make an area dispel instead of a targeted dispel.\n\nArea Dispel\n\n\nWhen dispel Psionics is used in this way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel Psionics. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more Powers, apply the dispel check as with creatures. psionic items are not affected by an area dispel.\n\nFor each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel Psionics power, apply the dispel check to dispel the power. For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the dispel Psionics power, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\n\nIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power (such as a weapon summoned by call weaponry) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the power that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one power targeting the creature or object.\n\nYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any power that you have manifested." compset="RaceCustom" summary="Cancels psionic powers and effects." uniqueness="unique">

When microcosm is manifested, you can target either a single creature within range or a group of creatures all located within the power’s area.\n\nSingle Target If microcosm targets a single creature, that creature’s senses are pinched off from the real world if it currently has 100 or fewer hit points.

It affects only creatures that currently have 30 or fewer hit points, and only up to a total of 300 hit points of such creatures. The power affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals first.

Two to five reality revisions manifested in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score. Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be negated or dispelled. An inherent bonus cannot exceed +5 for a single ability score. Inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack; only the best one applies.\n\nRemove injuries and afflictions. A single reality revision can aid one creature per manifester level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction.\n\nRevive the dead. Reality revision can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. This power can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two manifestations of reality revision, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. Reality revision cannot prevent a character who is brought back to life from suffering a permanent negative level or suffering from Constitution drain.\n\nTransport travelers. This power can lift one creature per manifester level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.\n\nUndo misfortune. Reality revision can undo a single recent event. Manifesting the power forces a reroll of any single roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.\n\nYou can try to use reality revision to produce more powerful effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. The manifestation may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.\n\nDuplicated powers allow saves and power resistance as normal (but save DCs are calculated as though the power is 9th level) and the power is treated as if manifested with 17 Psi Points, allowing the manifester to choose any appropriate augment options. Powers without augment options are simply manifested as normal, but with 9th level save DCs.\n\nManifesting reality revision requires channeling psionic power through specially-treated crystals similar to cognizance crystals that cost 25,000 gp. The crystal is consumed in the manifestation and becomes inert, unable to be used again and losing any value. If a power or spell duplicated by reality revision has a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component or additional crystals of the same value." compset="RaceCustom" summary="As bend reality, but fewer limits" uniqueness="unique">

Both you and the recipient of the tattoo (if the recipient is not yourself) must be present during the entire tattooing process. Magic tattoos must be placed on a part of the body normally able to hold a magic item slot, but they do not count against or interfere with magic items worn on those slots. A single slot can only hold one magical tattoo (nonmagical tattoos and tattoos acquired from the tattooed sorcerer archetype do not count against this limit). Tattoos may be inscribed on the following slots: belt, body, chest, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, ring (up to two), or wrist. They cannot be inscribed on armor, eye, headband, or shield slots.\n\nMagical tattoos are difficult to destroy, though they count as magic items for the purposes of dispel magic. The spell erase can permanently destroy a magical tattoo, but the bearer of the tattoo can resist the spell with a Will save, in addition to the caster needing to make a successful caster level check to erase the tattoo. Physically removing a magical tattoo with a sharp instrument or defacing it with fire or acid can destroy it as well. Doing so is a full-round action that not only requires the target to be willing or helpless, but also provokes attacks of opportunity. At least 2 points of damage per caster level of the tattoo must be dealt to destroy a magical tattoo in this manner.\n\nMagical tattoos follow the rules for magic item creation as though they were wondrous items, except that they can use the Craft (calligraphy, paintings, tattoos) skill. New magical tattoos can be researched and designed using the guidelines for pricing new magic items. Magical tattoos are treated as slotless magical items for pricing purposes." compset="CustomSpec" summary="A Mage can create tattoos on his body or someone else’s." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="cMPCHChEny" name="Channel Energy" description="Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol (see Channel Energy). This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.\n\nA good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous casting).\n\nChanneling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric&apos;s level + the cleric&apos;s Charisma modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect. A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability." compset="CustomSpec" summary="A good cleric can channel positive energy; an evil cleric can channel negative energy." uniqueness="unique">
