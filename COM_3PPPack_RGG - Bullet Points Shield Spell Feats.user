This increases the shield bonus to AC the spell provides by +2, but it also somewhat hinders your movements (even though it is weightless, the bigger field of indestructible force simple gets in your way occasionally), causing you to suffer a -2 armor check penalty. When employing a tower shield spell in combat, you take a &#150;2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield&#146;s hindrance.\n\nYou may reduce a tower shield spell to a normal shield by taking a move action to compress it back down to size.\n\nWhen you have a tower shield spell active, as a standard action you can use it to grant you total cover until the beginning of your next turn (in addition to its normal bonus to AC). When using a tower shield spell in this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for attacks that do not pass through this edge. As the shield spell is invisible it also provides cover (but not total cover) against targeted spells that pass through this edge." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">
