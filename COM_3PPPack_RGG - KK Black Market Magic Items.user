Any abilities that do not conflict with each other can occur (even random weapons are never holy and unholy at the same time, nor can they be both flaming and frost). The exception to this rule is that a random weapon is never axiomatic. A random weapon is always treated as having only two permanent magic properties: random and an enhancement bonus. \n\nIf the random property is added to  a weapon that already has other special abilities, those abilities are turned into enhancement bonuses equal to their bonus cost. (A weapon that would gain more than a +5 enhancement bonus as a result of this becomes a +5 weapon.) At dawn each day, a random weapon converts a randomly determined amount of its enhancement bonus into other special abilities. The weapon always retains at least a +1  enhancement bonus. (The random ability can only be added to a weapon with a +2 or greater enhancement bonus). Special abilities with multiple possible variations (such as bane) have those variables randomly determined as well. \n\nModerate universal; CL 13th; \n\n{b}Construction Requirements{/b}: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, {i}limited wish{/i}; Price +1 bonus.\n\n{b}Note:{/b} This thing has not been fully implemented yet." compset="ItemPower">

Such a ring grants the wearer the power to summon shadows to serve him . . . but sometimes they are difficult to control. The wearer's control over the shadow demon is based on his control score (level + Charisma modifier). When worn by a character with a total control score of 6 or less, the ring is a useless piece of jewelry. Once per day a wearer with a control score of 7 or more can use the ring to summon a shadow monster (as the summon monster I spell). The monster is randomly drawn from the options from one of the summon monster spells, as shown below, but it has the shadow creature template (below). \n\nControl Score Spell\n7-10 summon monster I \n11-13 summon monster II\n14-17 summon monster III\n18-19 summon monster IV\n20-21 summon monster V\n22-23 summon monster VI\n24-25 summon monster VII\n26-27 summon monster VIII\n28+ summon monster IX\n\nThe wearer's control over the shadow monster is not complete. If the creature rolls a natural 20 on any attack roll, skill check, saving throw, or ability  check, it is confused until the ring wearer reasserts control. If the ring wearer rolls a natural 1 on any attack roll, skill check, saving throw or ability check while the shadow monster is summoned, the shadow monster moves away from the controller for 1d4 rounds, then seeks weak victims to torture and kill until it's duration ends or the ring wearer reasserts control. For the ring wearer to reassert control, he must be within 30 feet of the shadow creature and make a control check (control score + 1d20) as a standard action against a DC of 10 + shadow creature's HD.\n\n{b}Construction Requirements{/b}: Craft Magic Ring, {i}shadow conjuration{/i}, {i}summon monster VI{/i}; Cost: 15,300 gp" compset="Ring" summary="Summon Monsters I-IX">

A tincture of prisms is addictive, with a moderate addiction, Fortitude DC 16. For more information on addictions, see the Drugs and Addiction section of Chapter 8 of the GameMastery Guide. As with most addictive materials, it is outlawed in many places, though it is also forbidden in some areas because officials feel it is unwise to encourage spellcasters to dabble in enchantment and necromancy just in case that is the school they boost with such a tincture. \n\n{b}Construction Requirements{/b}: Craft Wondrous Item, ; Cost: 1,250 gp\n\n{b}Note:{/b} This thing has not been fully implemented yet." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="ioSGTncRgn" name="Tincture of Regeneration" description="Description:\nA milky, spicy liquid that burns the tongue and clears the nasal passages, a tincture of regeneration causes the imbiber to immediately heal some part of every wound suffered for an hour after drinking. During this time the imbiber gains DR 3/- (representing the quick healing of three points of damage from each wound).\n\nThe increased metabolism is not without its side-effects, however. If any time during the tincture's effects the imbiber rolls a natural 1 on a Fortitude save, his regeneration causes him to produce a thick, bulbous growth on a randomly determined portion of his body. This causes him to suffer a -1 armor check penalty (due to its ungainly size and shape), which stacks with any other armor check penalty he might suffer. The growth is permanent unless removed (requiring a Heal check with a DC equal to 10 + target's Constitution score). On a failed check, the growth returns in 1-6 days.\n\nAlso, if the imbiber rolls an natural 1 on a Will save during the duration of the tincture, he becomes confused any time he is in combat (in addition to suffering whatever effect forced him to make a saving throw). This effect ends at the end of the tincture's duration, but returns if the target rolls a natural 1 on a will save any time in the next week.\n\nWorse, a tincture of regeneration is addictive, with a moderate addiction, Fortitude DC 17.

You can recharge up to three charges at a time by having the act include additional partners (one charge per partner), though you must actively engage all partners during the act. You cannot use the same partner to recharge the ring multiple times on the same day—to regain all 6 charges in one day requires a minimum of 6 partners.
