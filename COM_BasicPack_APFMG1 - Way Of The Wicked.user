V1.0 Data Input by Bodrin
bodrinbarlow@gmail.com

September 7, 2014 - Tim Shadow
-Merged all the different WotW .user files into two. One for GM's and one for Players.

May 13, 2013 - Tim Shadow
-Removed the "Training" and "Crimes" headers as it will not sort correctly and it just causes it to look really confusing.

11th May 2013 - Bodrin
Finished adding the "Training " Traits
Source marked the new "Training" type of trait.
Added logic to prevent two "Training" type traits from being taken.
Product Marked the Training traits to the "HL Community"

March 13, 2013 - Tim Shadow
-Added the "Evil Paladin" archetype for the Antipaladin that allows the class to have an alignment of NE or LE instead of CE.

March 6, 2013 - Tim Shadow
-Added Source to Way of the Wicked to everything.
-Product Marked everything to the "HL Community".

December 10, 2012 - Tim Shadow
-Removed the parent source from all Things. If the parent is source marked than if ANY child under the parent is checked marked they will appear. I don't think that is what is wanted in this case.
-Source marked the new "Crimes" type of trait.
-Added logic to prevent two "Crimes" type traits from being taken.

When created the two seals are conjoined usually by a ribbon or perhaps by wire or twine. To activate the magic, that connection must be broken. When that is done, the two seals fates are still linked regardless of the distance between them.\n\nIf one seal is broken, the other breaks issuing a loud sound of the creators choice (silence is also a choice) and then both become non-magical. Even if on another plane of existence the second seal will still break 95% of the time that the other is broken.\n\nAlso the seals are potent aids to scrying. Whenever a caster possessing one half of the seal attempts to scry someone possessing the other half, the seal counts as having a possession of the target (thus granting a -4 to saves to resist the scrying attempt).\n\n{b}CONSTRUCTION Requirements{/b} : Craft Wondrous Item, {i}sending{/i}; {b}Cost{/b} 700 gp" compset="Wondrous">

They are rectangular in shape, approx. 3.65 ft on one side and 5.87 ft on the other. They are covered in rows upon rows of strange dot patterns that seem that they must be some strange form of writing.\n\nDeciphering the writing is no easy task. The strange dot patterns upon the stone give little clue to their meaning. Still, someone with an almost miraculous gift for language could manage it (DC 40 Linguistics skill check). Other than that, it will take either a {i}miracle{/i} or a {i}wish{/i} to translate these tablets.\n\nOnce translated, these tablets give themselves no title. They reveal the inhuman doings of the Elder Things and reveal small hints of their extraterrestrial technomagical super science.\n\nWith a lifetime of study, a wizard or alchemist could go dramatically mad pondering the secrets of these tablets. But they do have a more immediate use.\n\nIf they are translated and then a DC 40 Knowledge (arcane) skill check is succeeded, then the reader can learn how to call up some failed elder thing experiments banished to a plane of nightmares. These tablets describe how to summon and control a strike force of 111 gugs.\n\nThe ritual requires correctly arranging the tablets in a precise and assymetric stack and then intoning a repeated gibberish prayer. This will summon the strike force and force them to serve the summoner for one full day. If fielded at the Battle of Tamberlyn, this grants the PCs a +4 bonus to their Might.\n\nThe tablets then nebulously speak of spacially rearranging themselves after the ritual is complete. What this means is that the tablets disperse to another unknown location upon another plane, likely never to be seen again. It is possible to stop this rearrangement only be using a {i}wish{/i} or {i}miracle{/i} before the ritual is cast. Otherwise the tablets will be lost.\n\nThere are no doubt other uses for the tablets that could be called upon by discovering other arrangements. Fundamentally, they appear to be conjuration nexuses capable of opening gates to many different strange and esoteric planes of reality and controlling what passes through them. However, using them is dangerous in the extreme and accidents such as the black deluge that was unleashed seem almost inevitable.\n\n{b}DESTRUCTION{/b} These tablets can only be destroyed by taking them to a strange place at the bottom of the world known as The Carven Rim and casting them into the utter abyss that lies beyond." compset="Wondrous" summary="Summon and control a strike force of 111 gugs.">

Your skin turns red and scaly, granting you a +2 enhancement to your natural armor bonus and DR 10/good. Your hands twist into a pair of wicked claws that grant you two primary natural attacks that deal 1d8 points of slashing damage (if you are Medium).\n\nIn addition, your tongue becomes long and forked, allowing you to make a primary natural attack that deals 2d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. This attack has reach, but can be used to attack foes adjacent to you.\n\nYou are also surrounding by a nimbus of flame. Any creature that is adjacent to you at the start of your turn takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This nimbus also grants you resist fire 10.\n\nFinally, you can end this effect prematurely to unleash a ray of pure hellfire as a standard action. Hitting a target with this ray requires a ranged touch attack. The ray deals 4d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for each round you have remaining in the duration. Half of this damage is fire damage, while the other half is unholy which ignores any resistances the target might have. Any spell resistance the target might have applies to this ray." compset="Spell">

The ring provides a +1 deflection bonus to anyone wearing it, but they soon find that the ring cannot be removed. Each day, the wearer must make a DC 15 Will save or suffer terribly dreams that evening.

His alignment shifts one step toward Lawful Evil, first moving from Chaotic to Neutral and then Lawful, followed by Good to Neutral and finally Evil.\n\nThis shift is permanent so long as the ring is worn. Those who know the wearer can make a DC 20 Sense Motive skill check to notice subtle changes in the wearer&apos;s behavior, such as rigid new grooming habits, a desire for order in all things, and a lack of empathy for other living creatures.\n\nThe ring can only be removed after a successful remove curse or by cutting off the digit that bears the ring. These foul rings are frequently made by the servants of Asmodeus and given as gifts to noble rulers or left to be found by foolish interlopers.\n\n{b}CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS{/b}\n{b}Magic Items{/b} Ring of Protection" compset="Ring">
