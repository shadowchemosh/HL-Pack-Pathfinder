However odd his clothing may be, it is generally agreed that the sight of his dreadful cape or even the shadow of his hideously quick movements chills the hearts of men.\n\nSpring-Heeled Jack stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rUmSpaCank" name="Moit of Shub-Niggurath" description="{b}Slugspawn{/b}\n\nBloated alien worms the length of a man&apos;s forearm, slugspawn are the basest form of a moit of Shub-Niggurath. These repulsive creatures possess sluglike bodies the color of rotting algae, covered with thick mucus. Vulnerable to the predations of larger creatures, slugspawn rarely venture forth on their own. Although they can move at a speed of 10 feet per round, slugspawn frequently hide themselves in dark pools or shadowy crevices, waiting for the warm flesh and pliant brains they crave to come to them.\n\nUpon entering a square with a slugspawn in it (or if attacked by a slugspawn), a creature must make a DC 16 Perception check to note that a slugspawn is something other than a normal slug (though hidden slugspawn can be more difficult to detect). If this Perception check is failed, the slugspawn leaps upon the creature and burrows into its flesh. The creature can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to avoid the slugspawn, but only if the creature is aware of the slugspawn&apos;s presence. Any amount of damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation.\n\nOnce a slugspawn has infested a living body, it burrows toward the host&apos;s skull and wraps around the lower brain, growing and feeding upon the energies generated by thought. On the first round of infestation, dealing cold damage to the victim can kill the slugspawn and save the host-but only if the victim takes 10 or more points within 1 round of being infested. Cutting the slugspawn out also works, but the longer it remains in a host, the more damage this method does. Cutting it out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 25 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has been infested. If the Heal check is successful, the slugspawn is removed. After 3 rounds, though, the slugspawn has reached the host&apos;s brain and cannot be surgically removed without killing the host. Remove disease kills any slugspawn in or on a host.\n\nAfter a slugspawn has reached a host&apos;s brain, it proves to be a beneficial parasite-at least initially. A slugspawn&apos;s host benefits from complete immunity to mind-affecting effects, as the slugspawn&apos;s presence confuses and devours such magic. This benefit doesn&apos;t last for long, though, as after a variable period (typically lasting 2d6 days in humanoids, though sometimes more or less in other creature types) the slugspawn matures into a spawning canker, a new stage in its lifecycle that begins with it violently devouring its host&apos;s brain, erupting from its skull, and taking over the beheaded host body-a near instantaneous process that immediately kills the host. The result is a new creature, a spawning canker garbed in its former host&apos;s skin. If the host is killed before the slugspawn fully matures, the parasite undergoes a rapid, emergency maturation, taking control of the host body as if it had fully matured-though such spawning cankers rarely prove as long-lived as their fully matured brethren." compset="Race">

The animating spirit of a phantom armor is typically invisible, the armored shell appearing to be the entirety of the creature. Casting spells like see invisibility or detect undead reveals the vague shape of a spirit seemingly wearing the armor.\n\n{b}Creating Phantom Armor{/b}\n\nPhantom armors of varying types can be created using the spell create undead, as detailed in the table. In addition to requiring a corpse for it to be cast upon, the spell requires that body must be wearing a suit of heavy armor. The corpse dissolves into the armor at the conclusion of the spell&apos;s casting." compset="Race">
    <comment>The Bestiary does not take into account the armor check penalty for heavy armor.   This penalty is not removed from this file.

Bestiary stats do not include +1 AC from Dodge feat.  This bonus is included here.</comment>

Though it is as brilliant as a lich, its only interests are in satisfy its cravings for sensation.\n\nThe Maw has little interest in the desires of mortals (or of undead in the mortal world) except for how they intersect with Urgathoa&apos;s orders. If it is necessary to eat a hundred members of her cult, or to drive an entire city of ghouls into a lava pit, the Maw does it. It can speak but finds little worth talking about, so many assume it is as mindless as an animated skeleton. However, when not on a mission of death, disease, or gluttony, it is a font of knowledge about food, wine, exotic scents, and other strange experiences only an undead creature can understand, and is quite willing to speak on these matters to an interested party-assuming the sight of the enormous talking, winged skull isn&apos;t a distraction to listeners.\n\nAlthough the Maw normally appears as a bare skull, it sometimes covers itself with its swarms. Whether this is out of a morbid sense of humor or an attempt to remember an old sensation from its life is unknown. It has confirmed that it was once a devourer, and before that a living creature, but it does not give further details." compset="Race">

Flitting through the winding halls of Pharasma&apos;s realm, they record the circumstances of each mortal&apos;s death, any judgments for and against its soul, and its final destination along the Outer Planes. Their efforts alone maintain the immense Catalogue of Last Days-the Boneyard&apos;s infinite library of precedent. But unlike more tireless, mechanical outsiders, nosois are also prone to powerful whims, boasting contests, and petty theft.\n\nMortals recognize nosois in their roles as messengers, counselors of troubled or disbelieving dead, and guides along the River of Souls, and some ancient texts refer to them as scribe psychopomps, death&apos;s messengers, and yanakeion.\n\nMany large and well-tended graveyards or catacombs play host to a nosoi who tends to the newly passed and keeps a watchful eye out for the looming taint of undeath. Nosois&apos; bodies take the form of mortal songbirds-usually crows, sparrows, and especially whippoorwills-though like all other psychopomps they wear graceful, elegant funerary masks that accentuate their sharp beaks and empty eyes. Many also craft decorative artificial tails from small bric-a-brac that trail behind them as they soar through the Boneyard.\n\nNosois are typically measure about 1 foot in length, though their tails may double or triple that length.

They can be troublesome, though, given their natural curiosity and tendency to steal small objects. Any neutral caster of 7th level or higher and who has the Improved Familiar feat may summon a nosoi.\n\nNosois often use their skill as scribes to aid their mortal masters. Despite their size and apparent lack of hands, they may use medium-sized drawing and writing tools without penalty. They grant their masters a +2 bonus on skill checks made to scribe scrolls.

Stern, silent, and cloaked in ragged wings, unsettling images of vanths haunt mortal depictions of death. Known as reapers, angels of death, or amzranei in some texts, members of this class of psychopomps serve as guardians of the Boneyard and watchers along the routes of the dead.\n\nThey provide security atop Pharasma&apos;s Spire and along the River of Souls, protecting the departed from those who see mortal souls as currency or delectable morsels. They also serve as death&apos;s foot soldiers against whatever would disrupt the natural cycle of mortality, be it a plague of undeath or a good-aligned temple that dispenses resurrections too freely. In times of great suffering and loss, Pharasma relies on the steely resolve and tireless nature of vanths to harvest the tormented souls of the dead before their agony transforms every battleground or plague quarter into a pit of undeath.\n\nVanths appear as black skeletons with crowlike wings and masks resembling the heads of vultures, crows, and other carrion birds-creatures that clear the mortal planes of corpses. Occasionally they cover themselves in ceremonial brass armor and tabards in funerary shades. Like all psychopomps, a vanth wears a funerary mask crafted from ceramic or polished stone in place of a face. Thanks to their slumped posture, vanths can look most adult humanoids in the eye, despite standing 8 feet tall when erect. They weigh approximately 400 pounds." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rUmPhArGua" name="Phantom Armor, Guardian" description="Raised from the corpses of knights and soldiers slain by treachery rather than battle or conflicts considered crimes even in the heat of war, phantom armors appear as suits of animate armor, walking or floating of their own accord. Most phantom armors haunt the halls and blasted battlefields where they were slain, seeking revenge against their murderers or, should that prove impossible, confronting any living creature that might give them the opportunity to do battle once more. Dastardly necromancers have also discovered the process for binding violent spirits to suits of armor, giving rise to eerie servants that combine endless patience with cold brutality. \n\nPhantom armors come in many shapes and sizes; some appear to be nothing more than animate helms while others resemble armored giants.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\n\nPhantom armors-being undead and having no need for sleep or sustenance-make perfect guards, especially given their single-minded demeanor and their innocuous appearances. While a phantom armor&apos;s suit is hollow, the spirit of a dead warrior still inhabits it, forever caught in the cold embrace of steel and forced servitude until it is defeated in battle. Of course, since not all suits of armor are alike, neither are all phantom armors. Horrific tales tell of ghastly knights floating through haunted corridors, their helmet visors revealing only blackness within. The animating spirit of a phantom armor is typically invisible, the armored shell appearing to be the entirety of the creature. Casting spells like see invisibility or detect undead reveals the vague shape of a spirit seemingly wearing the armor.\n\n{b}Creating Phantom Armor{/b}\n\nPhantom armors of varying types can be created using the spell create undead, as detailed in the table. In addition to requiring a corpse for it to be cast upon, the spell requires that body must be wearing a suit of heavy armor. The corpse dissolves into the armor at the conclusion of the spell&apos;s casting." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rUmPsYamar" name="Psychopomp, Yamaraj" description="Equal parts and regal and unspeakable to mortal sensibilities, yamarajes preside as judges of death and dispensers of ultimate justice.  Superstitions of the living call them by many names - the final judges, the grave magistrates, the dragons who eat men&apos;s soul - but all agree that these nobles of death wither even the stoutest hearts.  The grave magistrates glide with authority throughout Pharasma&apos;s Boneyard, commanding flocks of lesser psychopomps, tolerating the ministrations of devils and angels bickering for souls of note, and ordering the endless procession of petitioners.  Many also serve as diplomats or military commanders to maintain the Boneyard&apos;s neutrality.  But any such role is secondary to maintaining the flow of souls and the balance of the multiverse.  Though in theory each yamaraj answers to Pharasma, in practice each is unquestioned within its own courtroom.  \n\nYamarajes vaguely resemble black dragons, though they are easily distinguished once one realizes the gigantic creatures are cloaked in feathers rather than scales.  Each yamaraj measures at least 30 feet in length and weighs 4 tons.  Despite their massive size and largely sedentary duties, yamarajes show astounding grace when they do move." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rUmGrimRea" name="Grim Reaper" description="Known by many names throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the personification of death and all the pain and fear associated with that state.  They are universally feared by the living as harbingers of destruction and masters of all that has already passed from life.  These hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but themselves.\n\nWhile grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone.  The towering, ghostlike grim reapers are served by minor reapers, corporeal servitors that enact their master&apos;s dreadful will and meet out death&apos;s unrelenting touch.  A grim reaper is 15 feet tall and, as an incorporeal creature, has no physical weight except for its equipment.  Minor reapers stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\n\nGrim reapers have no creator and are not born by any definition of the word-they simply exist, much as the multiverse itself does.  Some philosophers argue that grim reapers were created along with the Negative Energy Plane, manifesting from this plane when mortalkind first realized death&apos;s terminal permanency.  Others claim that multiple minor reapers meeting on the Negative Energy Plane or another area infused with overwhelming negative energy might join together to form a new grim reaper.\n\nWhile similar in shape to the psychopomps who serve Pharasma and ferry souls to their fates upon the planes, reapers care little for mortal souls, reveling in the moment of death and dissolution of the impermanent, regardless of the elaborate bureaucracy that oversees the doomed.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\n\nWhile grim reapers stalk the planes, spreading death and despair for their own sakes, they are not alone in the endeavors.  Among their many powers, grim reapers can summon lesser versions of themselves to seek out and kill specific individuals.  These minor reapers are encountered far more often than their masters, either in the service of their masters or summoned by evil magic-users to do their foul bidding.  While stripped of their more powerful brethren&apos;s necromantic powers, these minor reapers are nonetheless brutal hunters and stop at nothing to achieve their objective.  Minor reapers usually wait until their target is alone before appearing for battle, though if a pack of these undead assassins are sent after a group of victims, they will engage multiple targets if necessary.\n\nIf summoned by a grim reaper, minor reapers act as its additional eyes and ears, and if they are destroyed, their master is immediately aware of their obliteration.  Other times, a grim reaper may summon minor reapers to aid in its escape from a battle it expects to lose, and flees to another plane of existence where it may recover and better prepare for the annihilation of its targets.\n\nGrim reapers possess the ability to speak to any intelligent being, and the few who have survived encounters with a reaper or its minions claim that the bringer of death spoke to them in a deep, unearthly voice like nothing in the material realm.\n\nMinor reapers can be created by casters of 20th level or higher using the spell {i}create greater undead{/i}." compset="Race">
    <comment>The stat block from the bestiary is not applying the Incorporeal subtype to this creature.  This variation does not allow for the +12 Natural Armor, and there is no attribute for STR and instead pulls the mod from DEX of +2, instead of +7 from a 24 STR as listed. This is not corrected in the .user file, but is added as bonuses in the .por file.</comment>

  <thing id="rUmGrReMin" name="Grim Reaper, Minor Reaper" description="Known by many names throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the personification of death and all the pain and fear associated with that state.  They are universally feared by the living as harbingers of destruction and masters of all that has already passed from life.  These hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but themselves.\n\nWhile grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone.  The towering, ghostlike grim reapers are served by minor reapers, corporeal servitors that enact their master&apos;s dreadful will and meet out death&apos;s unrelenting touch.  A grim reaper is 15 feet tall and, as an incorporeal creature, has no physical weight except for its equipment.  Minor reapers stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\n\nGrim reapers have no creator and are not born by any definition of the word-they simply exist, much as the multiverse itself does.  Some philosophers argue that grim reapers were created along with the Negative Energy Plane, manifesting from this plane when mortalkind first realized death&apos;s terminal permanency.  Others claim that multiple minor reapers meeting on the Negative Energy Plane or another area infused with overwhelming negative energy might join together to form a new grim reaper.\n\nWhile similar in shape to the psychopomps who serve Pharasma and ferry souls to their fates upon the planes, reapers care little for mortal souls, reveling in the moment of death and dissolution of the impermanent, regardless of the elaborate bureaucracy that oversees the doomed.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\n\nWhile grim reapers stalk the planes, spreading death and despair for their own sakes, they are not alone in the endeavors.  Among their many powers, grim reapers can summon lesser versions of themselves to seek out and kill specific individuals.  These minor reapers are encountered far more often than their masters, either in the service of their masters or summoned by evil magic-users to do their foul bidding.  While stripped of their more powerful brethren&apos;s necromantic powers, these minor reapers are nonetheless brutal hunters and stop at nothing to achieve their objective.  Minor reapers usually wait until their target is alone before appearing for battle, though if a pack of these undead assassins are sent after a group of victims, they will engage multiple targets if necessary.\n\nIf summoned by a grim reaper, minor reapers act as its additional eyes and ears, and if they are destroyed, their master is immediately aware of their obliteration.  Other times, a grim reaper may summon minor reapers to aid in its escape from a battle it expects to lose, and flees to another plane of existence where it may recover and better prepare for the annihilation of its targets.\n\nGrim reapers possess the ability to speak to any intelligent being, and the few who have survived encounters with a reaper or its minions claim that the bringer of death spoke to them in a deep, unearthly voice like nothing in the material realm.\n\nMinor reapers can be created by casters of 20th level or higher using the spell {i}create greater undead{/i}." compset="Race">
