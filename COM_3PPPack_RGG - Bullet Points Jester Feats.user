  <thing id="fSGCmbtJug" name="Combat Juggling" description="You can keep items airborne by juggling, making them available when you need them. \n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Dex 15, Deft Hands, Sleight of Hand 1 rank.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: You can juggle small items (those you could attempt to conceal on your body with a Sleight of Hand check), allowing you to treat multiple objects as being “in hand” and ready to use. The number of items you can keep ready for use by juggling is equal to the number of hands you have, plus your Dexterity modifier. Using this feat requires both your hands be free. \n\nWhile using Combat Juggling you can use all the items you are juggling as if you were holding them normally, but cannot take any action with one of the items that takes more than a full round to perform. If you are knocked unconscious, stunned, knocked prone, held, or prevented from taking standard actions for any reason, you drop all the items you are juggling. Any circumstance other than taking normal damage that would require you to make a concentration check if you were casting a spell, requires you to make a Sleight of Hand check with the same DC or drop all the items you are juggling. \n\nFor example, Giacomina (Queen of Jugglers, and Juggler of Queens) has a 15 Dex, Combat Juggling, a +11 Sleight of Hand bonus, and two hands. She is expecting a fight to start at a market, and thus is using Combat Juggling to keep four items ready (her maximum with 2 hands and a +2 Dex bonus) – a dagger, a cure light wounds potion, a loaded hand crossbow, and a smokestick. When the fight does break out she can attack with the weapons normally (and even reload her crossbow) and use the potion or smokestick as a standard action, all without needing to take further actions to ready or draw any of the equipment. If she was grappled she’d have to make a Sleight of Hand check (DC 10 + grappler’s CMB + spell level) to keep juggling, since she’d be forced to do that if she was casting a spell, and if knocked unconscious she drops everything." compset="Feat" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fSGDistrct" name="Distract" description="You can keep someone’s attention, even when they don’t want you to. \n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Cha 13, Bluff or Perform as a class skill.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: As a standard action you may make a Bluff or Perform check to distract a foe within 30 feet that is able to see and hear you. Your check is opposed by the target’s Perception or Sense Motive check (whichever is higher). If your check succeeds, until the beginning of your next turn creatures may make Stealth checks to avoid being seen by the distracted creature (or conceal some action they take) from the creature) even if circumstances (such as bright light or lack of cover) would normally prevent them from doing so. Additionally, the distracted creature has one less attack of opportunity available than normal.\n\nIf the creature is threatened or in combat, it gains a +5 bonus to its opposed check, +1 for every consecutive round you use Distract." compset="Feat" summary="You can keep someone’s attention, even when they don’t want you to." uniqueness="useronce">

If you cast hideous laughter at a creature already under the effects of the spell, and it fails its save, the duration of the second casting is added to the ongoing spell duration, and the target does not receive a saving throw on its second round to negate the second spell casting.\nAdditionally, even without the hideous laughter spell, you may make Perform (comedy) checks to demoralize foes able to hear and understand you (as the demoralize function of Intimidate)." compset="Feat" summary="Your comedy has a cruel streak that translates well to magic." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fSGPlyFool" name="Play the Fool" description="You can look like a complete idiot, at a professional level.\n\n{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Deceitful.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: As a move action you may make a special Bluff check to cause any creature observing you to conclude that any action you take on your turn is bumbling incompetence, and that any effect you create is accidental. Characters with Perform (comedy) as a class skill make use that skill to Play the Fool in place of Bluff. Creatures with an Int of 2 or less are immune to this check (they are too simple to care about motives). \n\nYou make a single Bluff check to Play the Fool, opposed by a Sense Motive check from each creature observing you. You do not use\nthe normal Bluff circumstance modifiers for this check, but for each round within 24 hours that a creature observes you attempting to\nPlay the Fool or make an attack or cast a spell without Playing the Fool, it gets a +1 bonus to its Sense Motive check. Once a creature wins\nan opposed check against your Bluff check to Play the Fool, it is not fooled by your use of this feat for 24 hours.\n\nThose creatures who do not beat your Bluff check conclude your actions this round are neither competent, nor intentionally antagonistic. While Playing the Fool if you attack a creature, the attack and any damage you deal seem to be coincidental. If you grapple a foe, you appear to just stumble into them and become entangled. If you cast a spell, you seem to be clumsily attempting simple cantrips, and any other spell effect surprises you as much as those watching. \n\nIf you successfully make a Bluff check to Play the Fool against a target, the next round you gain a +4 bonus if you make a Bluff check to feint. Doing this grants all creatures observing you a +10 bonus to Sense Motive checks to oppose your use of Play the Fool for 24 hours.\n\nAlthough determining that you are only accidentally dangerous is no guarantee creatures will choose not to attack or punish you, normally foes will select more dangerous-looking targets over you if given a choice in combat and guards are more likely to kick you out of town than imprison you. The exact reaction of NPCs to a damage causing idiot is up to the GM to decide." compset="Feat" summary="You can look like a complete idiot, at a professional level." uniqueness="useronce">
