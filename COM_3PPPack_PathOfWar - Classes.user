  <thing id="cPWWarlord" name="Warlord" description="Dynamos on the field of combat, warlords walk the line of victory and ruin through their determination to achieve glory. Where some may talk tactics, the warlord dives in. Where some may fight in strategic units, the warlord shines alone as an inspirational beacon on the field of combat; to be a warlord is to be a lord of war.{br}{br}{b}Adventures{/b}: Warlords adventure for many reasons, but one reason that will always be prominent is the desire to test their skill against the world&apos;s most dangerous opponents, to show their strength to themselves and to the world. Others may do this for profit, others for fun, others for revenge, but it is always certain that a warlord seeks the glory and honor only a battle well-fought can bring.{br}{br}{b}Characteristics{/b}: Brash arrogance and an irrepressible nature are hallmarks of the warlord. A devil-maycare warrior, many warlords are as fearless as they are fierce, and they both love life and live their lives to the fullest. Hedonists in some extreme cases, the warlord is drawn to combat as a moth to the flame.{br}{br}{b}Alignment{/b}: Any. Warlords can come from any and all ethical backgrounds, though they do tend more towards a chaotic alignment. Lawfully aligned warlords are rarer, and tend to compose their impulses through strict discipline.\n\n{b}Role{/b}: Striker. As a very aggressive class, the warlord seeks to bring martial power to the field in the form of overwhelming force and ferocity. Additionally, warlords make excellent leaders, as they provide some passive benefits from their class features as well as active benefits from discipline choices and their gambits." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

  <thing id="cPW1Gambit" name="Warlord’s Gambit" description="At his core, the warlord is a warrior who relies on both skill and daring; without this he is but any other combatant. By setting himself to danger, does his true skill shine, or so the motto of the warlord goes. At 1st level, a warlord selects two gambits as methods by which the warlord can recover expended maneuvers. Each gambit possesses three aspects - a {i}risk{/i}, a {i}rake{/i}, and a {i}reward{/i}.\n\nEach gambit&apos;s {i}risk{/i} describes an action that the warlord must undertake in order to attempt to recover an expended maneuver. The warlord begins a gambit as a swift action, effectively diving recklessly into the act he is attempting. The warlord then performs the action described in the gambit, and if he is successful, he regains maneuvers (see below). If he is not, he suffers the {i}rake{/i} of the gambit and only regains a single maneuver of his choosing. While performing a gambit, the warlord may add his Charisma modifier to the d20 check(s) to aid in accomplishing the gambit as a luck bonus. A warlord may attempt the actions of a gambit, but without declaring the attempt a gambit attempt by spending a swift action to do so, the character does not regain any maneuvers nor does he suffer a rake for failure. The character may initiate a maneuver while performing a gambit (if the maneuver helps him accomplish it) but he may not recover the maneuver used to achieve the gambit as part of the reward.\n\nA gambit&apos;s {i}rake{/i} is the penalty that the warlord suffers if he attempts his gambit and fails, such as failing a trip attempt or failing to strike an opponent with a charge attack. Each gambit possesses a unique {i}reward{/i} that the warlord enjoys for succeeding at that gambit. All gambits possess the same {i}rake{/i}; the warlord only regains a single expended maneuver and suffers a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls for one round. A warlord who succeeds at fulfilling his gambit immediately recovers a number of expended maneuvers equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 2) and enjoys the unique reward for each gambit. Allies who would witness the successful gambit and receive benefits must be within 60 ft. of the warlord and must be able to see him perform the action. Finally, gambits may not be initiated outside of combat due to their reliance upon the stresses of battle to bring out the best of the warlord.\n\nAt 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the warlord selects adds an additional gambit." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Regain maneuvers by taking risky actions">

The number of points in the stalker&apos;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 her stalker level + his Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).\n\nAt 1st level, the stalker may spend 1 point of ki to grant himself a +4 insight bonus to a single Perception or Sense Motive check as an immediate action, as he uses his ki to feel out the vibrations of others and their hidden motives.\n\nAt 5th level, the stalker may use his deadly strikes in conjunction with his combat insight to &quot;read&quot; his opponent&apos;s defenses and deliver devastating blows beyond his foe&apos;s guard. The stalker spends one point of ki as a swift action to read his target opponent, and may apply his deadly strike to all martial strikes initiated by the stalker for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier against this target. If the stalker scores a successful critical hit against the target while this ability is active, then he activates deadly strike as normal.\n\nAt 7th level, the stalker may spend 1 point from his ki pool to gain a +4 insight bonus on a saving throw as an immediate action.\n\nAt 9th level, the stalker can delve into his subconscious in battle and remember key lessons from his training. The stalker envisions potential scenarios where martial abilities he has not readied come into play and gains a momentary burst of martial insight. A number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, the stalker can spend one ki point as a swift action and trade one readied maneuver for another maneuver known of the same level or lower. The new maneuver is immediately readied and accessible for use. The character may initiate this maneuver and recover it as if he had prepared at the beginning of the day (or when ever the stalker readied his maneuvers last) until the end of the combat encounter.\n\nThe ki pool is replenished each day after 8 hours of rest and meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the stalker possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, stalker levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set.

The stalker&apos;s deadly strike activates whenever the stalker scores a successful critical hit against a target, and is active against that target for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier. Deadly strike inflicts extra damage, to only this target creature, on all of the stalker&apos;s attacks.

If the stalker scores a successful critical hit during the time his deadly strike is active, the duration of this ability is extended by one round (no more than one extension can be made per round). Ranged attacks can count as deadly strikes only if the target is within 30-ft.. Deadly strike is more effective with weapons with higher critical multipliers, such as scythes and battle axes. Weapons with a x3 critical multiplier inflict damage with deadly strikes using a d8 instead of a d6, and weapons with a critical multiplier of x4 use d10&apos;s. Damage multipliers higher than x4 use d10&apos;s for deadly strikes damage.\n\nDeadly strike may not be used with weapons that inflict non-lethal damage.

  <thing id="cPWWarder" name="Warder" description="Protective and disciplined warriors, warders are fighting men and women who use their knowledge of warfare, tactics, and strategy combined with superior combat training to accomplish their goals in defending others. Their intellect guides them through battle, and their skill at arms achieves their success.\n\n{b}Adventures:{/b} Warders adventure to further their employer’s missions, to serve on battlefields as protectors and champions, or to protect those that they care about. Some warders adventure to forge kingdoms of their own, battle tyranny, fight others of their kind for honor, or to live simply and by their own code.\n\n{b}Characteristics:{/b} Warders are always protective of people they deem in their care, be it a superior, their friends, or fellow soldiers of fortune. Many warders are proud, intelligent individuals who study tactics and maps as well while training daily with their associates to better suit their style towards their defense.\n\n{b}Alignment:{/b} Any, but most are lawful; the moral portion of their alignment is either up to them or their inclusion in their sect.\n\n{b}Religion:{/b} Many warders are religious, often following gods of war, chivalry, and sacrifice. Some follow gods of tyranny or justice, and others follow gods that stand for the good of their race.\n\n{b}Background:{/b} Warders find their place in their society based upon their line of adventuring. Some warders are regarded with great respect as leaders and guardians while others are feared and hated for their tyrannical ways. Many are respected and treated well in the hopes that if trouble comes, the warder will come to help those who showed them kindness.\n\n{b}Races:{/b} Nearly all humanoid races have warders amongst them. Dwarves, half-orcs, and humans make up the larger majority of warders in more civilized\nsociety, but there are a minority of halflings and gnomes that guard their kind from harm. While elves possess the tactical prowess to make great warders,\ntheir fragile bodies are often not enough for the physical rigors of the profession. While some warders are restrictive to whom they’ll share their secrets, it’s\nlargely agreed that the more monstrous races tend to be excluded. Hobgoblins, of the monstrous races, are by far the largest exception to that stereotype.\n\n{b}Other Classes:{/b} Warders get on well with those of a more orderly and martial bent, naturally befriending paladins, monks, and fighters. Rogues and warders\ndon’t exactly see eye to eye, while rangers and sorcerers might find a warder’s presence restrictive. Wizards and warders appreciate many of their shared\nfacets in learning, and warders widely recognize the importance of clerics in both martial and spiritual matters.\n\n{b}Role:{/b} Defender. Warders are natural guardians and protectors of the weaker members of the party, and are the ones who can take the most damage on\nthe front line. They also double as being coordinators on the battlefield, helping their teammates and providing support for them both defensively and offensively." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="20">

      ~ Basically, the issue is that initiating PrC's add maneuvers known/readied as if they were further levels in an existing initiator class.  So theoretically we could just have levels in the PrC add to the known/readied number of another class (or Martial Training).  However, there's a complication: PrC's often have their own discipline list for the known maneuvers they grant.  So we can't just add to another class's maneuvers; we need a separate configurator that can be tagged according to the disciplines allowed by the PrC.  However, we ALSO have to account for the fact that we're still acting as a previous class for the purposes of initiator level and modifier (do we use INT, CHA, etc for setting DC's).  So here, we have the user pick an existing maneuver source (either an initiating class, or Martial Training), and we pull the calculated IL and IM from that source.
      ~ I REALLY hate this solution, because it means creating phony "class features" to serve as UI elements, not to mention the way false impresssions it generates regarding how PrC maneuvers are handled by the game.
      ~ The timing is set so that we set the PrC config's level after those are normally calculated by PWSetupIL, but before maneuver IL's are inherited in the field's calc script.

      ~ Stop if no maneuver list has been chosen
      doneif (field[usrChosen1].ischosen <> 1)

      perform hero.findchild[Configure, root.tagids[ClsCountAs.?]].setfocus

      perform focus.pushtags[UseAttr.?]

      ~ Also inherit the initiator level from the other class
      focus.field[cfgLevel].value = field[usrChosen1].chosen.field[cIL].value

      ~ Finally, set the IL for the actual maneuver list

In current times, it is a rare practice that is both dangerous and in high demand by those in the know, with the deadly mage hunter selling his skills for the wealthiest purse. Some are not without honor, but if one thing unites all present day mage hunters it is their devotion to their profession and the power and respect it affords them. \n\nMage hunters hail from a number of different classes, but all share the ability to initiate martial maneuvers and they must have base knowledge in both combat and in stealth skills. Lastly, all mage hunters must learn from either a mentor or an ancient grimoire known as the {i}Grimoire Serpentis Ferra{/i} to learn their highly prized skills. All mage hunters learn sorcerous arts that aid them in their missions through ancient meditative practices, martial tradition, and mystical trials passed down by masters to students or from copies of the {i}Grimoire Serpentis Ferra{/i} itself." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">

Awakened blades, as they are called, learn to use their precognitive mastery as both offense and defense in pursuit of greater psionic knowledge and personal glory or power." compset="ClassLevel" maxlimit="10">
