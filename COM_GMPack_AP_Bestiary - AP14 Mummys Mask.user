  <thing id="rCBAhkat" name="Ahkhat" description="An ahkhat is an elemental entity that dwells within a single building or structure, such as a monument, temple, or manor. The floors and walls of this structure are the ahkhat&apos;s veins and arteries, and the doors and windows of the building are the creature&apos;s fingers and toes. An ahkhat exists solely to maintain and protect its attuned structure. Far from a mere house servant or magical butler, an ahkhat is its structure&apos;s consciousness incarnate.\n\nAhkhats are bound to their structures via a special keystone that&apos;s intrinsically attuned to the ahkhat, and they cannot leave the premises of their own volition. Furthermore, ahkhats cannot move through or manipulate structurally damaged parts of their attuned buildings, so they have a vested interest in maintaining the integrity of their demesnes.\n\nWhen an ahkhat manifests, most often it emerges from a wall as a humanoid-like head, arms, and a torso that jut out. While ahkhats can manifest full bodies as well, since they cannot move away from their attuned structures, they rarely have cause to.\n\nSince an ahkhat&apos;s body is one with the structure it embodies, it has no weight or size in and of itself. However, most ahkhats can extend up to 3 feet away from their resident structures; when emerging from the structure, its physical form weighs about 100 pounds, though this weight has no adverse effect on the structure itself.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAhkhats are a product of Ancient Osirian magic long lost to time. Since the means of creating an ahkhat seem to have been closely guarded secrets and the cost was likely extravagant, these creatures were rare even during the height of Ancient Osirion. Archeologists have discovered ahkhats in desert temples and lavish crypts, but most agree that common homes and other mundane structures likely did not house such beings. It&apos;s known that ahkhats are the result of severe and powerful magical alterations to earth elementals, though by what means and under what circumstances these modifications occurred remains unknown. The magic that caused such a metamorphosis must have been mighty indeed to transform an elemental into a native outsider, and is likely on par with the legendary deeds of the god-kings themselves. Like elementals, ahkhats need not breathe, eat, or sleep.\n\nWhile not designed for combat, when pressed, ahkhats attack with their powerful limbs, and can reach up through the floor and out of the walls to trip and grab opponents. They&apos;re also adept at snatching nearby objects and hurling them at range.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nAhkhats are solitary creatures without exception. Whatever modifications were made to those earth elementals that would become ahkhats stripped them of both their ability and desire to interact with other creatures, even with other members of their own kind. Ahkhats pay earth elementals as much heed as any other creature. Earth elementals, for their part, recoil at the sight of ahkhats; on some occasions, elementals have been known to rage uncontrollably upon witnessing what they no doubt perceive as an abomination and mockery of their kind.\n\nOnly one ahkhat keystone can be attuned to a particular structure or building at a time. Attempting to install a second ahkhat keystone into an already-occupied structure results in a series of violent tremors that pulse throughout the building and rock the structure to its very foundation. During this time, the keystones crack and fall apart, and both crumble into useless piles of rubble unless one is removed within 3 rounds.\n\n{b}Ahkhat Keystones{/b}\nEvery ahkhat is tied to its own keystone, which is usually a stone block that weighs hundreds of pounds. The keystone must be included as part of a structure&apos;s foundation or cornerstone, or must be exchanged for a mundane keystone as part of a permanent alteration effected by a skilled artisan. Ahkhat keystones are usually difficult to locate, and are sometimes protected by a locked or secret door, devious traps, or magical protections. The outward appearance is typically a carved icon of a humanoid figure, beneath which is written the ahkhat&apos;s name in Ancient Osiriani.\n\nAnyone who speaks the ahkhat&apos;s name while touching its keystone can attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, CL 15th, Will DC 17 negates), and may even do so while the ahkhat is elsewhere in the structure. If an ahkhat is under the control of two or more creatures at the same time, it tries to obey both to the best of its ability. If it receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the ahkhat obeys. An ahkhat cannot approach within 10 feet of its keystone unless granted permission by someone who has successfully used the keystone. Once tamed by use of the keystone, the ahkhat typically assumes a passive or subservient attitude toward the creature that activated it, even after the duration of the charm effect has expired. The ahkhat perceives this creature as the master of the house.\n\nBy use of its keystone, an ahkhat can be ordered to enter its keystone and remain there. The stone can then be removed and built into a different building as part of a major construction undertaking or even used in constructing a new building. This is the only way to transplant an ahkhat without destroying it. Details on how to create an ahkhat keystone have faded with time; the knowledge is lost along with the magic that created the first ahkhats." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBShasalq" name="Shasalqu" description="While some reptiles bask in the sun&apos;s warm embrace to raise their body temperature, a shasalqu is ravenous in its search of warmth. Even in the deserts of the Inner Sea region, it never seems to have enough heat. Instead of just relying on the sun, a shasalqu gathers energy by sapping the heat from the air (and creatures) around it. An icy, saw-toothed ridge protrudes from its back, and its tail ends in a small club of accumulated ice. A shasalqu uses the intense cold generated from this heat absorption to trap its prey, which is often unprepared for the effects of blistering cold in the middle of the desert. Fighting shasalqus is dangerous business as their cold flesh damages any creature coming into contact with them. A shasalqu is 3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 40 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nMost desert scholars believe that strange biology that fuels a shasalqu&apos;s heat absorption ability is the same as that of brown mold, and some even claim that the creatures carry brown mold spores in their bodies. This could account for shasalqus&apos; ability to sap heat from their surroundings even after they die. Shasalqus have rough, gray-blue skin dotted with small beady extrusions much like those of a horned lizard. Because of their sandy environs and the drops of water that melt off their icy ridges, shasalqus&apos; bodies are often caked in a layer of gritty mud. Motionless shasalqus are often mistaken for rocks or small muddy clumps from a distance-a mistake desert travelers quickly come to regret.\n\nShasalqus&apos; ability to harvest heat from nearby creatures makes them one of the few types of lizards that actively hunt at night. They prefer eating warmblooded creatures, so they prey upon nocturnal desert fauna such as rabbits, desert foxes, and nesting birds. By catching prey in their chilly auras, shasalqus can bring down animals that would normally have the advantage of speed. Occasionally, shasalqus creep up on encampments and kill travelers&apos; camels while they sleep. Shasalqus prefer to eat larger animals since these creatures can provide food for days, but because they dwell in the resource-poor desert, they typically eat whatever they can. Shasalqus are particularly partial to fire elementals or other supernaturally warm beings, and may pursue such creatures for days in single-minded pursuit of heat and sustenance.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nShasalqus live primarily solitary existences. They are territorial creatures and mark off their territory with a unique scent, by which others of their kind can readily determine whether they have come across that particular shasalqu before. To maintain their territorial boundaries, shasalqus must walk the perimeter of their claimed land once every few days to ensure that their scent sticks. They deliver their scent through the droplets of water that melt off their hides (their &#147;sweat&#148;) during their patrols. When a shasalqu comes across the territory markers of another shasalqu, it slowly follows the edge of the other&apos;s territory, giving ample time for a greater volume of its own droplets to permeate the ground and deliver a stronger scent. The difference between the scents of two shasalqu is almost imperceptible to other creatures, leaving many creatures unaware of territory wars between two or more shasalqus.\n\nShasalqus dwell in hidden places. Their rocky lairs can be found near oases or along trade routes where prey is likely to wander by. Near oases, they make their lairs far enough away to allow them to sneak up on drinking or bathing creatures and then retreat to their lairs with little effort. When a shasalqu finds a trade route within its territory, it also ensures that its lair is not so close to the route as to betray its presence.\n\nRegardless of their location, shasalqu lairs are often extremely damp since the desert&apos;s heat melts the accumulated ice that crusts on shasalqus&apos; hides. This makes shasalqu lairs breeding grounds for a variety of mosses and plants, especially those that can withstand colder temperatures. These tiny oases rapidly become too mossy for the shasalqu, forcing it to leave its den in search of a new one. Shasalqus frequently keep multiple dens within their territory and rotate between them.\n\nIn rare cases, brown mold forms in the darkened corners of the den, leading some naturalists to conclude that the strange lizards carry spores from this dangerous mold. This conclusion has led expeditions of naturalists into the blazing desert to locate abandoned shasalqu dens and collect samples of brown mold from them. To avoid entering shasalqu dens on their own, these naturalists use long-handled scoops that they prod into the shasalqu den to collect the dangerous mold. Since shasalqus are not immune to cold damage (merely resistant), they abandon their lairs when patches of brown mold form.\n\nSometimes shasalqus&apos; moist and muddy lairs attract other thirsty desert creatures. Shasalqus can easily contend with the desert foxes and occasional weary traveler, but should a more powerful creature come across their dens, shasalqus either remain perfectly still, hoping the creature will drink and leave quickly, or else they slink away to avoid confrontations, only returning once the threat has passed.\n\nThough shasalqus usually keep to themselves, some naturalists have recorded clusters of them in places with abundant food. In these rare situations, a hierarchy forms among these simple creatures, and the leader is invariably the shasalqu with the largest ice-club on its tail, a visible status indicator among shasalqus. Shasalqus that challenge the current alpha end up in quick brawls for superiority. In these fights the challenger often tries to ruin its icy spines or to chip off portions of the ice that has accumulated on the leader&apos;s tail, so its opponent has a less impressive display. Because of this behavior, and the fact that the clubs grow more ice eventually, the dominance of these rare clusters of shasalqus is in constant flux.\n\nDesert nomads sometimes capture shasalqus and use them as sources of water. They dig pits to serve as enclosures for the lizards, and feed them captured rodents or birds. With the shasalqus safely ensconced in these makeshift wells, the nomads then harvest the resultant condensation as a slow but sure method of obtaining water in the desert. Because of the deadliness of the shasalqu&apos;s frigid aura, such hunters often try to catch the creatures with long nets or lassos, and even then only the hardiest and most desperate attempt the feat. For one far from the nearest oasis, the capturing a shasalqu could mean the difference between life and death by dehydration." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBSunFalc" name="Sun Falcon" description="Sun falcons are birds of omen in Osirion, with a reputation that goes back to the days of the nation&apos;s most ancient gods. In many myths and stories, sun falcons act as the eyes of many deities, though most commonly for Ra, who considers these birds to be among his holy creatures on Golarion. Sun falcons seem to watch over important people and oversee noteworthy events-sometimes from far enough away to be mistaken as a star visible during the day, sometimes from close enough to appear as a second sun. Today, the ancient gods are largely forgotten, but sun falcons still gravitate toward Osirion&apos;s heroes and pharaohs, suggesting that these abandoned gods are not so distant.\n\nA typical full-grown sun falcon weighs 2 to 3 pounds and measures 18 inches from beak to tail, with a wingspan approaching 5 feet.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nScholars believe that the brilliant plumage of sun falcons wasn&apos;t a natural or even a magical evolution so much as it was divine gift, granted by Ra in the first days of these favored birds&apos; existence. Ancient papyrus scrolls and carvings found in ruins claim the ancient gods of Osirion desired a way to inform mortals they were being observed, and so Ra created the first sun falcons from common desert falcons, imbuing them with his power to shine as bright as the desert sun so as to be seen across the land. This divine gift suffuses every feather on their bodies. Individual lost or stolen feathers shed light as a candle for up to 7 days after being detached, and are often in high demand to accent elegant attire for the upper class.\n\nDespite being creatures blessed with the heat of the sun, sun falcons are mortal and require normal sustenance to survive. To avoid reducing their captured prey to unpalatable ash, sun falcons vent gouts of fire from within, slowly lowering their body in temperature to a level that allows them to consume their meals without first incinerating them.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSun falcons live deep within the deserts of Osirion, though they aren&apos;t unknown in Thuvia or even as far west as Rahadoum. They build nests atop rocky outcroppings from gravel, pebbles, and shards of metal capable of withstanding their natural heat, but often abandon their nests only months after creation. How long a particular nest has been inhabited can be identified by the darkness of the rocks it is made from. The stones from particularly well-used nests may even have begun to fuse together from the heat, and are typically lined with crude glass formed from melted desert sand. Some enterprising folk collect these abandoned nests wherever they can be found, and sell them in bazaars throughout the desert lands. But as a typical sun falcon may build dozens if not hundreds of these nests over the course of its life, only the most heavily used or otherwise impressive nests have any real value.\n\nSo long as a sun falcon remains in a particular nest, it ranges for hundreds of miles in search of prey, primarily desert rodents and other small birds, though they have occasionally been known to attack much larger prey. When fighting anything larger than itself, it begins the attack by making several passes close overhead, relying on its inborn radiance to scorch and exhaust its prey before diving in for the killing blow.\n\nSun falcons are only aggressive when hunting or provoked. Most often, this provocation comes from opportunistic profiteers searching for abandoned nests or molted feathers. An aggravated sun falcon takes to the sky, and over the course of several days it might attack everything it sees-stranding travelers, setting caravans ablaze, and even drying up oases in its rage. When fighting, a sun falcon usually opens combat with its blinding flash ability to confound its victim&apos;s senses. Following this initial attack, the sun falcon keeps its distance and uses its breath weapon. It then uses Flyby Attack to strafe its target and remain out of the creature&apos;s grasp. If its fiery attacks don&apos;t seem to affect its victim, the sun falcon disengages from the fight and moves on.\n\nSun falcons have few natural predators, and they are canny enough to easily avoid most mundane hunters. Their ability to fly protects them from most desert predators, and their natural talents with heat and fire help them fend off any other foolish creatures. The biggest threat to sun falcons comes from efreet who walk the deserts of northern Garund. Immune to many of the sun falcons&apos; attacks, efreet hunt sun falcons for sport as if they were common pheasants, dining on the creatures and using their radiant plumage as decorations on their clothing and armor.\n\nThe mating habits of sun falcons have long confounded scholars, as every member of the species ever examined has been a mature female, carrying a single already fertilized egg. Because of the birds&apos; association with Ra, some postulate that these eggs are divinely fertilized, though sun falcons are capable of breeding with males of other falcon species, and the result of these unions is always a baby sun falcon. This method of reproduction creates slight variations in the appearance of offspring, but the creatures&apos; abilities are the same.\n\nA sun falcon lays these eggs on an annual cycle, and each bird has its own cycle. It takes approximately a month for an egg to hatch once it has been laid, and a chick reaches full maturity after only 2 months. Sun falcons are often born already capable of flight. Until the chick matures, it hunts alongside its mother as she teaches the fledgling vital skills. After reaching maturity, the young sun falcon departs into the desert to build its first nest and begin its own cycle.\n\nThe only exceptions to this rule are when a sun falcon bonds to another creature. The subject of this bond is typically a humanoid who is suspected to have some great destiny in store. A sun falcon doesn&apos;t live with its bonded creature or even have much direct contact, but it keeps nearby, flying above the village or city the person lives in or trailing the person in her travels if she happens to be a desert nomad or leaves her native lands. This bonding process has proven flawed as often as not in the current Age of Lost Omens-though the falcon follows this creature for the remainder of its life, the bonded person is no more likely to have a great future in store for him then might any other. While some skeptics claim that those who believe this legend grant such chosen individuals more chances than they would otherwise receive, artificially inflating their chance of success, others&apos; beliefs also result in unrealistic expectations that these &#147;blessed&#148; individuals constantly fail to meet, which can lead them to instead despair or be rejected by the public." compset="Race">

Scarabs are small, six-legged insects with sharp protrusions on their front legs that they use to aid in burrowing. They are primarily coprophagous, eating dung for sustenance. An individual scarab often spends days rolling a single ball of detritus across the desert until it can find the perfect place to bury and deposit eggs in the dung. Because of this practice of burrowing underground to create new life, scarab beetles have long been associated with Osirian burial rites and the church of Pharasma.\n\nA scarab swarm comprises thousands of scarab beetles, each filthy from its constant contact with dung. Normally inattentive toward other creatures, scarab swarms subject those that get in their way to thousands of sharp bites as well as a highly infectious disease. Indeed, the bites of a scarab swarm are the least of their victims&apos; worries, as the disease they carry claims far more lives than their hunger.\n\nSome religious scholars theorize that scarabs are prone to swarm because they&apos;re drawn to the same malign energy that causes some undead to rise in Osirion, though most people regard this explanation as purely superstition. Some worshipers of Pharasma see the arrival of a scarab swarm as a portent for ill fortune and upon encountering such a sight utter quick prayers to the Lady of Graves." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBPsyEsob" name="Psychopomp, Esobok" description="The mad dogs of the Boneyard, esoboks are the blunt and vicious predator caste of psychopomps. They patrol the Spire as feral hunters, hungry for undead flesh. Though as outsiders esoboks don&apos;t have to eat and draw no sustenance from this behavior, the spark of undeath is a feast for their every sense, and they pursue and ravenously consume undead creatures given the chance.\n\nMortals rarely see these otherworldly hunters, and only those steeped in the ways of death know of their existence. They hazily creep into the edges of living mythologies, appearing as torturers of fallen souls or delivering a gnashing end to mortals whose souls don&apos;t meet Pharasma&apos;s expectations. In truth, esoboks show a curious neutrality towards petitioners. Only the living- and even more so the undead-catch their eye, while the truly dead have little to fear.\n\nEsoboks are stout, physically impressive specimens, with dog-like bodies and the girth of rhinoceroses or hippopotamuses. Their bodies are bald, aside from a thick collar of oily feathers at their necks, but bear distinctive spots, stripes, or patterns that identify individuals. Even among psychopomps, there is speculation regarding how to differentiate between male and female esoboks, or even whether they have physical sexes. The typical esobok stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder and nearly as wide, and weighs upwards of 300 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLike all psychopomps, esoboks are native to the Boneyard and Pharasma&apos;s Spire. Esoboks are savage and dogged beings, gifted with impressive teeth and claws, but they are less intelligent than other psychopomps, and less perceptive. They do, however, possess an uncanny ability to sniff out the negative energy that animates undead. Their bodies are nearly unassailable, with an immune system any living scavenger would envy. In addition to dealing physical damage with their bites, an esobok can plunge its eldritch jaws deep inside a creature and tear out the living essence that sustains its prey. The ties that bind soul to body are strong, though, and esoboks eventually lose their grip on all but the weakest of spirits, at which point the spirits return to their victims&apos; bodies. Some fringe cults even summon esoboks expressly to loosen the spirit from a guru&apos;s physical body, allowing her to seek wisdom unburdened by the trivial concerns of the living.\n\nWhile as outsiders they have no need to eat or drink to survive, esoboks&apos; gnawing hunger and focused purpose cause them to grow restless, irritated, and unpredictable if denied prey too long. They favor unliving meals, but will hunt anything they can chase. Esoboks prefer rich sources of negative and positive energy-such as characters who can channel energy, beings that radiate these energies naturally, or potions and scrolls of various cure and inflict spells-but most every entity in the multiverse holds some shining seed of energy that an esobok would savor.\n\nMost psychopomps arise from the souls of the unaligned dead, and bring an unusual amount of their living selves with them into eternal services. Esoboks instead rise from the Boneyard itself. Most believe they are the souls of animals, bound into eternal service by Pharasma. A few scholars of esoteric lore believe the Spire forges the creatures from lingering shreds of soulstuff that have flaked from the countless weary dead. Whatever their origins, esoboks lack the strong personalities common among other psychopomps. They have few personal proclivities and loathe individuality.\n\nWithin the Boneyard, packs of esoboks roam like wolves, constantly searching for intruders and those who would raise the dead or interfere with their tombs. These feral packs carve out territories and defend them from outsiders and even other psychopomps. While they prefer the taste of undeath, esoboks eat their fill of infernal or celestial trespassers. Only petitioners and other psychopomps escape their predation.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nEsoboks are the savage guard dogs of Pharasma. While vanths serve as eerily disciplined soldiers, morrignas hunt fugitives of the system, and other psychopomps tend to the bureaucracy of death, esoboks are her guardian beasts. Uncorrupted by ethical questions or personal desires, they simply shred whatever they encounter.\n\nTheir unruly nature and limited intelligence make esoboks ideal border guards and attack animals. Like vanths, their behavior is alien and unsettling, seemingly devoid of the mortal heritage of most outsiders. Vanths find the creatures comforting, and frequently recruit them to direct their savage fury against astradaemons, night hags, and others who might profit from interfering with the River of Souls. Yamarajes permit only the most disciplined of esoboks within sight of the Boneyard&apos;s great palaces of justice and record halls, and even then only when tightly chained.\n\nEsoboks are never trusted to retrieve the souls of the fallen. Despite their fondness for petitioners, they are rough and simple-minded brutes that are difficult to control. Even if allowed to visit the mortal world, they require short leashes and disciplined masters. They most frequently accompany vanths to sites of undead infection, and more rarely act as muscle for morrignas tired of subtlety. Occasionally, mortal summoners call forth esoboks to contain outbreaks of undead-their joy at the taste of undead flesh usually keeps them from causing much harm to other creatures. If they lack undead prey, however, esoboks stranded on the Material Plane prey on whatever they can chase and catch.\n\nThough esoboks respect and fear more powerful psychopomps, only vanths seem capable of training them into anything more than crude animals. Such trained esoboks grow substantially in power, as their newfound discipline taps into their latent magic. These war dogs have the advanced simple template and gain the following spell-like abilities, each usable once per day: ear-piercing scream, haunting mists, and teleport." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBEsoWarD" name="Psychopomp, Esobok War Dog" description="The mad dogs of the Boneyard, esoboks are the blunt and vicious predator caste of psychopomps. They patrol the Spire as feral hunters, hungry for undead flesh. Though as outsiders esoboks don&apos;t have to eat and draw no sustenance from this behavior, the spark of undeath is a feast for their every sense, and they pursue and ravenously consume undead creatures given the chance.\n\nMortals rarely see these otherworldly hunters, and only those steeped in the ways of death know of their existence. They hazily creep into the edges of living mythologies, appearing as torturers of fallen souls or delivering a gnashing end to mortals whose souls don&apos;t meet Pharasma&apos;s expectations. In truth, esoboks show a curious neutrality towards petitioners. Only the living- and even more so the undead-catch their eye, while the truly dead have little to fear.\n\nEsoboks are stout, physically impressive specimens, with dog-like bodies and the girth of rhinoceroses or hippopotamuses. Their bodies are bald, aside from a thick collar of oily feathers at their necks, but bear distinctive spots, stripes, or patterns that identify individuals. Even among psychopomps, there is speculation regarding how to differentiate between male and female esoboks, or even whether they have physical sexes. The typical esobok stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder and nearly as wide, and weighs upwards of 300 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLike all psychopomps, esoboks are native to the Boneyard and Pharasma&apos;s Spire. Esoboks are savage and dogged beings, gifted with impressive teeth and claws, but they are less intelligent than other psychopomps, and less perceptive. They do, however, possess an uncanny ability to sniff out the negative energy that animates undead. Their bodies are nearly unassailable, with an immune system any living scavenger would envy. In addition to dealing physical damage with their bites, an esobok can plunge its eldritch jaws deep inside a creature and tear out the living essence that sustains its prey. The ties that bind soul to body are strong, though, and esoboks eventually lose their grip on all but the weakest of spirits, at which point the spirits return to their victims&apos; bodies. Some fringe cults even summon esoboks expressly to loosen the spirit from a guru&apos;s physical body, allowing her to seek wisdom unburdened by the trivial concerns of the living.\n\nWhile as outsiders they have no need to eat or drink to survive, esoboks&apos; gnawing hunger and focused purpose cause them to grow restless, irritated, and unpredictable if denied prey too long. They favor unliving meals, but will hunt anything they can chase. Esoboks prefer rich sources of negative and positive energy-such as characters who can channel energy, beings that radiate these energies naturally, or potions and scrolls of various cure and inflict spells-but most every entity in the multiverse holds some shining seed of energy that an esobok would savor.\n\nMost psychopomps arise from the souls of the unaligned dead, and bring an unusual amount of their living selves with them into eternal services. Esoboks instead rise from the Boneyard itself. Most believe they are the souls of animals, bound into eternal service by Pharasma. A few scholars of esoteric lore believe the Spire forges the creatures from lingering shreds of soulstuff that have flaked from the countless weary dead. Whatever their origins, esoboks lack the strong personalities common among other psychopomps. They have few personal proclivities and loathe individuality.\n\nWithin the Boneyard, packs of esoboks roam like wolves, constantly searching for intruders and those who would raise the dead or interfere with their tombs. These feral packs carve out territories and defend them from outsiders and even other psychopomps. While they prefer the taste of undeath, esoboks eat their fill of infernal or celestial trespassers. Only petitioners and other psychopomps escape their predation.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nEsoboks are the savage guard dogs of Pharasma. While vanths serve as eerily disciplined soldiers, morrignas hunt fugitives of the system, and other psychopomps tend to the bureaucracy of death, esoboks are her guardian beasts. Uncorrupted by ethical questions or personal desires, they simply shred whatever they encounter.\n\nTheir unruly nature and limited intelligence make esoboks ideal border guards and attack animals. Like vanths, their behavior is alien and unsettling, seemingly devoid of the mortal heritage of most outsiders. Vanths find the creatures comforting, and frequently recruit them to direct their savage fury against astradaemons, night hags, and others who might profit from interfering with the River of Souls. Yamarajes permit only the most disciplined of esoboks within sight of the Boneyard&apos;s great palaces of justice and record halls, and even then only when tightly chained.\n\nEsoboks are never trusted to retrieve the souls of the fallen. Despite their fondness for petitioners, they are rough and simple-minded brutes that are difficult to control. Even if allowed to visit the mortal world, they require short leashes and disciplined masters. They most frequently accompany vanths to sites of undead infection, and more rarely act as muscle for morrignas tired of subtlety. Occasionally, mortal summoners call forth esoboks to contain outbreaks of undead-their joy at the taste of undead flesh usually keeps them from causing much harm to other creatures. If they lack undead prey, however, esoboks stranded on the Material Plane prey on whatever they can chase and catch.\n\nThough esoboks respect and fear more powerful psychopomps, only vanths seem capable of training them into anything more than crude animals. Such trained esoboks grow substantially in power, as their newfound discipline taps into their latent magic. These war dogs have the advanced simple template and gain the following spell-like abilities, each usable once per day: {i}ear-piercing scream{/i}, {i}haunting mists{/i}, and {i}teleport{/i}." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBSha" name="Sha" description="Once more prominent in Ancient Osirion, shas are favored creatures of the god Set, and faded scrolls detailing the past of Osirion refer to more powerful versions of these creatures the people called Set beasts. Considered heralds of the dark god Set, shas stalk the deepest deserts, only skirting the edge of civilization. Villagers whisper that a sha nears when they spot faint red lights in the distance, believing those lights to be the menacing eyes of the sha. Many times, simple worry drives these sightings, but shas live in the deep deserts and they certainly keep an eye on humankind. An urge to hunt the people who forgot their patron drives shas to attack caravans, harass remote villages, and prowl isolated oases to slaughter humanoids.\n\nBlack fur, tinted with the dust and sand of the desert, covers a sha&apos;s body. The creature&apos;s eyes glow a dull red. Explorers report that seeing a sha&apos;s eyes glowing in the dark night is often the only indication of an impending attack. A sha&apos;s strong jaw, lined with razor-sharp teeth, allows the creature to drag down larger prey in a fashion similar to a wolf. Standing at chest height to most humans, shas weigh between 100 and 150 pounds. Shas possess a distinct canine appearance, and they are often mistaken at night for common jackals whose eyes are illuminated by firelight. This misidentification was prevalent in Ancient Osirion as well, leading some to wrongfully associate the creatures with Anubis. These days, scholars and those who still worship the old gods of Osirion are among the few people who correctly identify these beasts and their deific association.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLegends state that shas were once simple canine animals long ago. The Osirian deity Set admired their reliability as trackers, hunters, killers, and masters of the deep deserts, and so blessed these early creatures with supernatural powers and sapience to create the first shas. Possessing the gifts of keen perception and eyes that would never tire, shas served Set as protectors of his cults and weapons to be sent against rivals. They also have the ability to understand the tongue of ancient Osirion, though they lack the physical capability to speak the language. This way, the creatures can understand and carry out commands, but lack any way to disagree or communicate displeasure at their directives. Set gave his loyal beasts the ability to conjure supernatural sandstorms, tying them closer to his portfolio as god of storms. This power allows the creatures to obfuscate their approach and drive off dangerous enemies, yet the creatures&apos; ability to see through their own sandstorms allows shas to pick off their quarry unhindered. Set also imbued his beasts with the ability to transmit horrific plagues upon those they bite, weakening their victims&apos; minds and driving the victims deep into madness.\n\nWhen Set first imbued the shas with divine might, his creations were much more powerful and cunning. With the passage of millennia and the gradual decline of Set&apos;s worship, his blessings have faded, resulting in the shas that now prowl the deserts. On rare occasions, a convergence of old sha bloodlines results in a particularly formidable, devious, and cruel sha known as a Set beast, which Osirionologists believe is the original form once taken by Set&apos;s favored creatures. Malice and strength are not the only qualities passed from generation to generation; shas still seem to remember the source of their power, for they attack those who openly display holy symbols of other gods before savaging those who show faith in one of the gods of ancient Osirion.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nMost shas lead a solitary existence, though some end up finding a lone partner to hunt with or a small pack to join. When alone, a sha spends its days trekking the vast wastelands of the desert, prowling among lost monuments that were once proud accomplishments of ancient Osirion. Those exploring such sites must keep alert, because shas plan ambushes and silently stalk their prey, often waiting until their victims emerge from darkened ruins before striking. While wandering the deserts, shas also attack small convoys or groups of nomads along the desert fringes. Using their innate ability to conjure sandstorms, shas close in on the unsuspecting groups and try to injure as many different enemies as possible, then retreat before their foes can regroup. By doing this, the shas ensure that survivors return to civilization mad with disease and then spread the sickness to others or act on their insane urges.\n\nWhen packs of shas come together, they usually do so because a number of their kind happened upon each other in pursuit of a caravan or some other nomadic prey, then decided to continue hunting together once they fed. If a group forms, it follows a strict hierarchy that revolves around the strongest sha taking the lead. If more than one sha feels it has the right to lead, the pack forms a circle and the two shas fight until one submits to the other. Such competition never takes place if a Set beast is present; the pack members acquiesce to this greater creature and follow its commands unerringly, lest they invite its wrath.\n\nSet beasts travel the breadth of what once constituted Ancient Osirion, as lone wanderers or packs that never stray far from the ancestral borders of that old empire. The largest enclaves roam the deserts of modern Osirion and Thuvia, generally avoiding civilization until the urge to hunt overtakes them. A handful of sizeable packs even hunt in the open wilds of Katapesh, seeking trade convoys to ambush. Deeper into the Brazen Peaks, a pack of shas has recently been harassing settlements of Pahmet dwarves between Oe-Tet and Erekrus, going so far as to stalk the dwarves as they travel between towns. Groups of shas dot the eastern edges of Rahadoum, where their infectious bites have strained the resources of many settlements that lack divine healing. For protection from these creatures, a handful of remote settlements and nomadic wanderers in Osirion once again embraced their ancient religions and began paying token homage to Set, hoping their meager efforts would stave off any further attacks from shas and Set beasts." compset="Race">

Such desiccated corpses near pyramids or other areas with strong necromantic magic sometimes rise as sunbaked zombies. With their corporeal bodies warped by the sun, and their innards but a dry facsimile of living organs, sunbaked zombies use the gifts of the sun to lash those who cross their paths. A sunbaked zombie is the same size as its original form, but typically weighs less than half its original weight.\n \n{b}Necrology{/b}\nOther than the dry, leathery skin clinging to the creature&apos;s bones, the most striking physical difference between a sunbaked zombie and a normal zombie is the sunbaked zombie&apos;s flame-filled eye sockets. Though it lacks functioning eyes-those having long since shriveled to dust-the sunbaked zombie can see as well as any other zombie, and the flames in its dried sockets can set enemies afire. With its dried, taut skin and taut and insides reduced to dust, it retains a normal zombie&apos;s resistance to damage. When its animating spark is extinguished, a sunbaked zombie&apos;s corpse bursts into a cloud of poisonous gas, choking those around it.\n\nSo long as the sun shines, sunbaked zombies move about as if with purpose. At night, however, they wander in circles until the sun blazes across the morning sky once more. The faint light given off by their eye sockets, combined with their stumbling movement, has led some desert nomads to claim they are desert will-o-wisps.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSun-baked zombies most often rise near pyramids and other burial sites in hot deserts, where latent necromantic energy lingers from countless arcane rituals and restless spirits. As such, sunbaked zombies are primarily found among the dunes of Osirion and the other nations that make up northern Garund. Typically animated in isolation, sunbaked zombies rarely form hordes like normal zombies, but when entire caravans fall to thirst and the desert sun, all of its members might rise as these terrible undead.\n\nWhen one intentionally raises a sunbaked zombie using animate dead, the body to be raised must be left out in the sun&apos;s rays for a full 12 hours and must be salted every hour during this time to hasten its desiccation. Spell effects that produce light work for this purpose only if they count as actual sunlight, and even then they must be combined with desecrate. Casting the animating spell at night always fails; the sun must be out and directly beating down on the corpse.

  <thing id="rCBTekenu" name="Tekenu" description="Guardians of long-abandoned tombs, tekenu are the result of a vile practice that instills the discarded piles of flesh left over from the mummification process with an unholy awareness. Separated from the sacred organs placed in canopic jars, tekenus attempt to reconnect with their counterparts among the living by killing creatures so that they can absorb intestines, livers, lungs, and stomachs into their squirming forms-a process that grants the undead creature additional powers.\n\nTekenus have been known to hide inside canopic jars collected from excavations (cleverly pulling the lid closed), attacking passersby like a trapdoor spider. Adventurers searching through lost reliquaries and tombs of ancient Osirion commonly call these foul creatures &#147;gutswarms&#148;; however, the name scholars give them is derived from an ancient Osirian term for the cast off remains of mummification rituals. A tekenu has an ever-changing form roughly 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, essentially the size of a robust humanoid&apos;s torso and abdomen. The mass weighs about 40 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nScholars debate the genesis of the tekenu. Some propose these atrocities are the creations of sects of evil priests in ancient Osirion, as they have been encountered only in tombs in that nation and of that era. However, several groups claim responsibility for the creation of the tekenu, including modern cults of Kabriri and Urgathoa. More cautious and traditional scholars claim that the tekenu are instead undead abominations resulting from improperly conducted mummification rituals, specifically ones in which the incision to remove organs was performed by a criminal or laborer.\n\nThe viscera that constitute a tekenu make it less susceptible to weapon damage and provide it with defensive abilities similar to those of swarms. In fact, until a tekenu absorbs one of the sacred canopic organs, it poses no stronger a threat than that of a swarm of Tiny vermin. The absorption of a sacred organ, however, prompts a radical transformation in the tekenu. Only fresh organs or those preserved by magic enhance the tekenu in this way. Unearthed tekenu have typically consumed one or two organs, normally those belonging to laborers trapped in the tomb at the time it was sealed.\n\nIntestines merge with the discarded remnants to act as long, rope-like appendages, which the tekenu uses to snag and pummel prey. Consuming a liver allows the tekenu to poison its victims and wither their bodies. A set of lungs gives the swarm the ability to hide as a pile of dried gore and increases its mobility. When the tekenu consumes a stomach, its attacks carry a digestive acid to help break down their victims. Of these organs, the tekenu shows particular affinity for absorbing the lungs first, as most adventurers discover a tekenu after being deceived by desiccated viscera they assume to be harmless.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nCreated in ritual chambers and tombs, most tekenus have no choice of where they are found. Only the most perverse of ancient nobility would have tekenu present in their final resting places. In the most heinous of cases, tekenu would be stealthily placed into a resting chamber immediately prior to the tomb&apos;s sealing. This serves as a final insult to the dead, leaving the undead abomination to break into the holy canopic jars and consume the vital organs within while they were still fresh enough to bestow power. In cases where a tekenu was used as a guardian, a fifth jar was placed inside the tomb to house it.\n\nIn some cases, either because the canopic jars were exceptionally sealed or because they were absent altogether, a tekenu may have none of the abilities granted by its canopic consumption ability. Once its tomb prison is breached (by explorers or some natural calamity), the tekenu becomes a roaming hunter, leaving its lair in search of fresh organs to consume. Acting on base instinct, the creature hunts until it successfully absorbs all four required organs. Upon gathering these absent parts, the tekenu then moves back to the tomb of its creation, where it dutifully guards the site from future intruders. Although a tekenu is barely intelligent, it is drawn to the site of its creation, a lingering result of the ritual that created it.\n\nA tekenu has no ability to communicate or interact, and its thoughts, if read by some form of magic, are simple and instinctual. As it preys upon only living and recently dead creatures, it often overlooks constructs and undead. Rare necropolises can be found filled with larger groups of these undead creatures, sealed away in remote chambers or allowed to wander the greater complex unopposed. These groups of tekenus-given stewardships by the priests of Ancient Osirion-ignore other tomb guardians, provided they are not living creatures. These tekenus are set to roam the necropolis consuming small rodents and vermin in the same manner a wizard might use an acidic ooze to dispose of waste." compset="Race">

Assassin bugs partially bury themselves in the sand or hide among clusters of thorny bushes found near oases, waiting for the next palatable creature to approach. When prey arrives, the insects burst out of hiding and pierce their prey with their elongated mouthparts, injecting a potent toxin that paralyzes victims. Once prey is safely paralyzed, assassin bugs feed by siphoning the victim&apos;s fluids. Even if these bites don&apos;t kill their prey, they are extremely painful and cause swelling in the area. Giant assassin bugs lay eggs in places shaded from the sun at all times, such as shallow caves or the crevices between rocks, preferably in a place where food is readily available for the hatching young. The soft-bodied young that hatch resemble their mature counterparts in all ways but size, and are fully ready to hunt the moment they emerge, though they typically seek much smaller prey.

  <thing id="rCBSerpopa" name="Serpopard" description="Avistani naturalists named this creature serpopard because they saw it as possessing features of both a leopard and a serpent, though this creature is also widely known by its Osiriani name sedja, meaning &#147;one who travels from afar.&#148; Serpopards earn this appellation because of their supernatural ability to leap from one dune to another, an ability they call &#147;stepping between the dunes.&#148; Some scholars speculate that the pharaohs of old bred this ability into the serpopards in order to create scouts and messengers able to cross the harsh terrain of their vast empires quickly and efficiently, but this creature is not one that has been created or influenced by humankind. Though rare, serpopards are naturally occurring beasts native to the deserts of northern Garund. Superstitious folk who believe that the gods&apos; hands touch everything beneath the blistering Osirian sun see the serpopard as a cursed creature, marked with snake-like features by Apep and forced to wander eternally through the desert, never to find rest or sanctuary. On the other hand, carvings on ceremonial plates, on uncovered artifacts, and in ruined temples make it clear that the god-kings of Ancient Osirion once kept serpopards as pets or servants, as depictions of these creatures in the oldest of Osirion&apos;s ruins often show them chained or collared, bowing obediently to human masters.\n\nSerpopards stand approximately 3 feet tall at the shoulder; when their necks are fully extended, they can measure up to 20 feet long from nose to tail. Serpopards weigh anywhere from 150 to 200 lbs.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThough serpopards are most common in the deserts of northern Garund, travelers in such far-off locales as the Meraz Desert in Qadira, the Cinderlands of Varisia, and the vast expanse of Shaguang in Tian Xia to the east have spotted creatures matching the serpopards&apos; description. Some sages hypothesize that the most powerful or ancient serpopards can cross greater distances with their dune step ability, and thus travel through it to distant deserts across Golarion. Such experts say it&apos;s therefore likely that all deserts hold populations of serpopards, though they may be few in number or very isolated.\n\nSerpopards are largely nocturnal, preferring to hunt at night when they can use the cover of darkness to approach prey undetected. When hunting, they rely on their speed and powerful claws to take down large quarry, and then use the additional reach provided by their unusually long necks to defend their kills from scavengers and competing hunters. Serpopards are not averse to eating intelligent beings, and hunt humanoids if the opportunity or need arises, but they aren&apos;t cruel-serpopards gain no pleasure from such acts beyond the satisfaction of a fresh meal.\n\nOn average, serpopards have a lifespan of about 50 years, but rumors exist of serpopards living much longer than this. One town along the northern coast of Rahadoum claims a single serpopard has visited its outskirts once every decade for the past 100 years.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSerpopards are mainly solitary creatures. Very rarely do they travel in pairs, and then only during mating season or in the case of littermates who chose not to separate at adulthood. When living as mated pairs, the father stays only until the cubs are able to run, but the mother stays with the cubs much longer, teaching them how to hunt and use their special ability to travel between the dunes. Mothers also pass on to the cubs their understanding of the land, instructing them as to which areas are good for hunting or exploring, what kinds of places to avoid, and how to find fresh water. Young serpopards separate from their mother individually, leaving as soon as they mature and feel confident navigating their way through the desert alone.\n\nWhen traveling, serpopards range anywhere from 50 to 100 miles per day, stopping only to hunt, rest, or (more rarely) explore some aged ruin. No one knows what fascination these ancient works hold for the serpopards, but the creatures&apos; interest in such locations is undeniable. An old poem involving serpopards claims that the creatures visit these ancient ruins because they are pining for the lost empire of Ancient Osirion.\n\nSerpopards are clever liars and frustrating conversationalists, and hold a reputation among other races as skilled deceivers. In rural parts of Osirion, those with a gift for deception are often said to have &#147;the tongue of a sedja,&#148; while young children caught in a lie are warned that their &#147;necks are growing&#148; with each lie they tell. Despite this potential untrustworthiness, many people still seek the aid of serpopards. Few creatures know the deserts of Osirion as well as serpopards, and for the right price many are willing to guide groups of people across the desert. It&apos;s usually best to ensure the serpopard is well fed before undertaking such a journey, however, for a hungry serpopard may turn on its traveling companions if it thinks it can make a quick meal out of them. Serpopards have little use for gold and rarely accept it as payment for their services, though some apparently take a liking to jewelry, as travelers report the creatures as frequently wearing necklaces and bracelets when encountered. Food and hospitality are always acceptable payments, for those two things are in short supply in the harsh expanse of the desert. For those wishing to earn a serpopard&apos;s true faith and loyalty, however, one form of compensation stands above all others-divination magic. Serpopards are unceasingly curious about what their futures hold, and put great stock in the words of those who can tell fortunes or predict events to come.\n\nSerpopards attack most sphinxes on sight, often fighting at least long enough to get in a few solid blows before retreating between the dunes to safety. The only exception to this is androsphinxes, which most serpopards fear for some unknown reason. Only the bravest or most desperate serpopards face down such creatures in combat without aid; most flee immediately once they spot these mighty sphinxes. Sphinxes are aware of this antipathy and treat serpopards accordingly. Perhaps as a consequence of their antipathy toward sphinxes, serpopards also hate riddles and word games, and prefer to twist their words with lies and omissions rather than making a game out of conversation. Ignorant travelers who confuse the two creatures and try to engage the serpopard in a bout of riddling can find themselves in a dangerous predicament." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBShalkes" name="Shalkeshka" description="A dangerous nuisance in northern Garund, a shalkeshka is a strange burrowing predator that inhabits fertile soil near rivers, oases, and (most destructively) farmland. This creature&apos;s anatomy is reminiscent of an insect or some sort of lizard, and when burrowing it tears into the earth with its claws, swimming through sand and soil. Since the creatures spend most of their time buried underground, their pale, nearly transparent skin is cool and clammy to the touch. Shalkeshkas feed on whatever creatures are unfortunate enough to tread the ground above them while they nest in the earth below. When fighting, a shalkeshka viciously grapples its victim with its mandibles, shredding its prey to pieces with its claws.\n\nSquat and powerfully built, a shalkeshka stands only 5 feet tall, but is 8 feet wide and weighs almost 2,500 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAlthough shalkeshkas are predators, they have a unique ability to derive nutrition from the ground itself if unable to find prey. This serves the creatures well in the lands of northern Garund, where desert travelers are few and far between and the harsh sun and unforgiving terrain keep roaming fauna to a minimum. While burrowed, a shalkeshka can enter a state of hibernation wherein it can sustain itself by absorbing minerals from the soil. A shalkeshka absorbs nutrients through the tufts of hair distributed across its long body, each of which is capable of leeching valuable sustenance from the very ground. This method of feeding can sustain a shalkeshka for extended periods of time-anywhere from a few hours to weeks, or even years-without the need to hunt. A shalkeshka breaks its hibernation only when it senses prey or during the rare times it succumbs to the urge to reproduce.\n\nA shalkeshka&apos;s bristly hairs also serve as one of the creature&apos;s sensory organs, allowing it to sense subtle vibrations in the ground. Its compound eyes provide it with excellent vision, and the third eye on the center of its forehead enables it to see in even the darkest of lighting conditions. Its enhanced senses ensure that a shalkeshka remains a constant threat to those who intrude on its territory, regardless of time of day or whether its prey is above or below ground.\n\nA shalkeshka ambushes its prey with impressive speed, bursting from beneath the sand and snatching unwary foes with its mandibles. Once engaged in combat, a shalkeshka fights with unrestrained ferocity. When it encounters groups of prey while hunting, a shalkeshka burrows beneath the ground to stealthily follow them until a member splits off from the group. The shalkeshka then emerges, grabs the straggler, and dives back into the sand to devour its newly acquired meal. If unable to snag its target, a shalkeshka remains above ground until it has subdued or slain its prey. They are powerful creatures, but lack the intelligence to make strong tactical decisions when it comes to engaging a target. However, if the tide of battle turns against a shalkeshka, it doesn&apos;t hesitate to burrow away to safety.\n\nShalkeshkas can live for over 300 years, though most of this time is spent hibernating underground. Shalkeshkas experience periods of fertility only a few times in their lives, during which they lay their eggs in hidden tunnels in the desert. Shalkeshkas stay near their eggs during the yearlong incubation period, sometimes even letting prey pass by untouched in order to conceal the eggs&apos; location. In rare circumstances, however, a pair of shalkeshkas that are both about to lay their eggs will tolerate each other&apos;s presence, instinctually recognizing the need for extra defense during the process. Such mutual defenses are dangerous for other intruders in the region, as the two shalkeshkas can then work together to bring down larger prey. Once the young hatch, they emerge from their leathery eggs in a larval stage that lasts for a year, culminating in a cocoon stage. During their larva stage, shalkeshkas subsist solely on nutrients in the soil as their mature mouthparts have yet to form. Shalkeshkas feel little kinship with their broodmates and soon begin splitting off from the group. As the cocoon stage nears, the parent shalkeshkas leave the area, leaving the young to fend for themselves. Any shalkeshkas still living in close proximity to their broodmates when they reach adulthood often cannibalize their siblings in great burrowing clashes until only one or two shalkeshkas hunt in the immediate vicinity.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nMany wandering shalkeshkas travel throughout the great deserts of Osirion, stopping only once they have claimed a lush territory for themselves. Though they can live in the deepest desert, shalkeshkas prefer territory with a source of water, for prey is more plentiful there, and while lying in wait enjoy the abundant nutrients in the soil-the creatures are notorious for setting ambushes near riverbanks or in oases. A single small oasis can sustain a shalkeshka for its entire life.\n\nWhen adult shalkeshkas encounter each other, violence soon follows. A shalkeshka that has claimed a territory defends it to the death against intruding shalkeshkas seeking to claim it; these vicious fights often leave both opponents injured. Shalkeshkas also frequently battle ankhegs, as they often share similar environments. Many a caravan has had to alter its path after happening upon a clash between these two burrowing beasts.\n\nThese are not the only times a desert caravan must be watchful of shalkeshkas. The creatures grow most aggressive when far from fertile soil, and a train of packed camels and their riders driving across the desert serves as an enticing meal for shalkeshkas in nutrientpoor lands. These attacks inspired the Osirian saying &#147;claimed by the shalkeshka,&#148; which is used to describe someone who has gone suddenly missing or a caravan contract that never pans out." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBThrDanc" name="Thriae Dancer" description="For as stoic and pragmatic as the thriae may be, they do appreciate art, grace, and beauty. This is exemplified not only by their ornately crafted weapons, armor, and jewelry, but also by their renowned dancers. These talented individuals are the most honored performers of their race, and they grace the halls and temple chambers of every thriae colony.\n\nWhile all thriae can be considered the epitome of alien grace and charm, thriae dancers are always among the most beautiful of their kind. They are typically 6 feet tall and weigh 140 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nOther races may scoff at the fact that thriae dancers seemingly rely on merope consumption in order to channel their mystical power into their dances, but there is much more to this act than one might realize. A thriae dancer&apos;s reliance on merope to execute her awesome performances is akin to a ballerina&apos;s reliance on her specialized shoes-while a ballet can be performed without them, the final result lacks a certain amount of finish without this integral element. So too does a thriae dancer&apos;s use of merope enhance her performance, with the potent serum pushing her body to its utmost limits. As the merope courses through a dancer, she channels her mysterious art into a spiritual energy capable of thrusting viewers to previously unknown heights of pleasure, awe, and sorrow. It&apos;s true that thriae are a stoic, nigh-unflinching race, but in the middle of a thriae dancer&apos;s performance, it&apos;s rare to see any thriae witnesses unmoved by such a powerful spectacle.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nLike all thriae, a dancer&apos;s role in the colony is chosen for her during adolescence, and she&apos;s thereafter cared for and trained by elder members from the same occupation until ready to perform on her own. A dancer&apos;s training takes many years of concentrated effort and tutelage from her superiors, during which time she&apos;s permitted to see no one but her fellow dancers. Thriae seers reason that dancers must be completely virginal in order for them to channel only the purest forms of nature&apos;s secrets. All training takes place within a special temple room in the thriae colony, where incense derived from merope is burned constantly to ensure the dancers&apos; focus is sustained for hours on end.\n\nDancers train in troupes, and most performances are choreographed group pieces performed once a month in the colony&apos;s largest hall, with an audience of thriae from all parts of the colony and caste system. The buzz of wings and even the sound of twitching antennae become muted as thriae soldiers, seers, and workers eagerly witness the highly spiritual dance ceremony. Drones-those humanoid men inducted into thriae society-are not permitted to witness thriae dances, as to behold such beauty would surely drive them irreparably mad.\n\nOnly the most talented and coveted thriae dancers are permitted to perform alone-there&apos;s typically only one such dancer in the entire colony, though some colonies might host a pair of honored performers. The solo or duet performances of these honored individuals are considered sacred affairs, and are typically attended only by the queen and upper class thriae such as seers, royal consorts, and generals. Venerated by their peers, these dancers are known as thriae terpsichoreans, and occupy the upper echelons of thriae society. Thriae terpsichoreans typically have levels in bard, are at least CR 9, and have access to the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-{i}heroism{/i}, {i}suggestion{/i}; 1/ day-{i}zone of silence{/i}." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBCynosph" name="Sphinx, Cynosphinx" description="Cynosphinxes are hoarders of secret knowledge and guardians of abandoned ruins. Those who intrude upon the realm of a cynosphinx and fail to offer a tribute of secret knowledge provoke the beast to savage anger. Whereas androsphinxes barter information for the sake of achieving enlightenment, cynosphinxes strive to learn secrets to gain power over others. Often, a cynosphinx enters a parley hoping to secretly learn clandestine information with its ability to read its target&apos;s thoughts, steering the conversation toward such topics with leading questions. Quick to anger, the cynosphinx kills those it feels are inferior, knowing that it still has the opportunity to converse with the trespasser after its death. If the knowledge it seeks is relayed during clever, amusing conversation, the sphinx rewards the provider with invaluable clues to a desired object or location, or simply safe passage through its territory, though the cynosphinx rarely shares any of its own secrets willingly. A cynosphinx stands 12 feet tall at its powerful shoulders. Built of muscular flesh and sinew, a cynosphinx weighs roughly 1,200 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nRare even among sphinxes, a cynosphinx is a terror of the desert. Were it not for its fixation on secrets, it would be a scourge to all who dwell among the sands. Its canine head grants it a sense of smell superior to that of other sphinxes, giving it the ability to stalk prey in conditions of poor visibility. Though it possesses massive wings, a cynosphinx is an ungainly flier. In addition to hit-andrun attacks from above, one of its favored tactics is to hover over an enemy and whip up a cloud of dust and debris to blind its prey.\n\nLike all sphinxes, a cynosphinx is long-lived, but it has a particularly selfish desire to cling to its lengthy existence, making it a careful combatant who will flee rather than perish. This obsession usually leads a cynosphinx to search out the secrets of longevity and immortality, not just for its own use, but also because it knows the value mortals place on such secrets.\n\nA cynosphinx requires little sustenance and even prefers to feed on carrion, finding rotting flesh more palatable. Because of this, an area with a few hundred gravesites can sustain a cynosphinx for several millennia. Even when a cynosphinx makes a fresh kill, the creature lets it rot for several days before devouring the carcass. Its diet mainly consists of the decaying corpses found abandoned within its lair, with bone marrow being a particular treat. Due to its affinity with the dead, and its obsessive need to learn secrets, a cynosphinx always interacts with its exhumed morsels, speaking with the dead and learning what it can before fully consuming the body. Like a scholar devouring knowledge from a book, a cynosphinx pores over both the physical and intellectual particulars of its strange corpse diet.\n\nWhen a cynosphinx it sees fit to mate-usually once its will to live ends-it needs a gynosphinx, just like other sphinxes do. However, due to the cynosphinx&apos;s disdain for mating, not to mention gynosphinxes&apos; utter disgust toward cynosphinxes, this type of union is rare. In nearly every case, the resulting offspring from such a pairing is a cynosphinx. Gynosphinxes want nothing to do with such offspring, and offer no protest when the cynosphinx takes the progeny away. Before it dies, the new father brings the child to its lair, leaving its progeny a carcass to learn from and feed upon.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nCynosphinxes dwell among the abandoned burial sites of civilized folk. Due to their obsession with lost secrets and their steady diet of carrion, a cynosphinx&apos;s ideal lair is a graveyard, tomb, or necropolis. When a cynosphinx takes up residence at such a site, the otherwise contemplative creature defends its territory with tenacity. However, if a visitor approaches a cynosphinx&apos;s territory with the promise of divulging secret lore, the sphinx may grant an audience. In such an instance, if the promise of lore fails to satisfy the cynosphinx, the intruder finds herself quickly under attack. Fortunately, many tombs and necropolises have tight nooks and narrow crannies far too small for a cynosphinx to maneuver in. If a clever traveler offers to explore these regions for the obsessive cynosphinx, she may find this arrangement to be just the bartering chip she needs to leave the sphinx&apos;s territory alive.\n\nSolitary by nature, a cynosphinx truly feels comfortable only among the dead, and leaves its lair only for brief, localized patrols or when a longer journey promises to unearth lost knowledge. Cynosphinxes are always male and treat other sphinxes as inferior, save for androsphinxes. Cynosphinxes ignore criosphinxes, subjugate hieracosphinxes, and only associate with gynosphinxes for the purpose of mating-an act cynosphinxes find revolting. If a cynosphinx finds its only recourse to extend its legacy is through mating, this is usually done through blackmailing a gynosphinx or resorting to other forms of coercion or subterfuge. In fact, a cynosphinx would rather discover a means of extending its own lifespan than sire an offspring-as they view even their own progeny as threats to their well-guarded store of knowledge. Toward the androsphinx, the cynosphinx harbors a seething jealousy. Envious of the androsphinx&apos;s superior intellect, wisdom, and guile, a cynosphinx will plot to murder any androsphinx it discovers. Cynosphinxes believe they can extract a wealth of knowledge and learn powerful secrets from the carcass of a slaughtered androsphinx using their speak with dead ability. If a cynosphinx&apos;s food supply is abundant, the one category of creatures with whom it will ally is the undead. It is common for a cynosphinx to take a place at the head of an undead menace or even to serve a greater power such as a graveknight or a lich.\n\n{b}Cynosphinxes as Mounts{/b}\nAlthough they have the physical ability to carry a rider, cynosphinxes cannot be trained as mounts. They are intelligent beings who choose for themselves whether to accept a rider. A worthy rider is usually a powerful undead creature of evil alignment with whom the cynosphinx has an obsession, or who has promised eldritch secrets in return for service. Often, a creature petitioning a cynosphinx for this arrangement must provide such knowledge regularly for the cynosphinx to continue to grant its consent as a steed. A cynosphinx is considered a special cohort, not a normal mount." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBEstuari" name="Estuarine Worm" description="When Alboras, one of the brightest navigable stars, returns to the night sky, it is a sure sign the River Sphinx will soon flood its banks and replenish the land after the harvest. The inundation also revives the rare but deadly estuarine worms. During the wet season, which is called akhet in Osiriani, the giant worms hunt the flooded plains. When the waters recede and Alboras disappears below the horizon again, the estuarine worms retreat as well. During shemu, the dry season, they enter a semi-torpid state and lie buried beneath the dry soil for protection.\n\nA typical estuarine worm measures 25 feet long and 3 feet wide during the wet season. The worms have a bioluminescent organ atop their heads. At night, the tiny, flickering light might be mistaken for a star low on the horizon. When the dry season comes, the estuarine worm contracts to become half as long and half as wide. Its skin, once soft and spongy like wet mud, becomes as hard as stone.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nEstuarine worms are most active when the River Sphinx is at its highest levels and crests its banks. Though the farmers leave when their lands flood, those who live on the edges of the flood plain, as well as those who sail the river, are still at risk of attack by these predators. Estuarine worms bury themselves in the mud during the day and emerge to hunt at night when it is cooler. The carnivorous worms eat whatever they can find, from fish and frogs, to livestock and people. They have even been known to gorge on crocodiles and hippopotamuses, after which they bury themselves for a time in order to digest their hefty meals. The lights on their heads attract small animals above and below the water, which in turn can attract larger prey. Stories are told of travelers who mistake the light for Alboras and navigate their small riverboats right into the maw of a worm.\n\nAs the floods recede, the estuarine worms become less active. When the land above them is no longer underwater, the worms remain buried in the moist soil. For the rest of the year, they live off fat and water stored during the wet season. The worms&apos; flesh contracts, becoming denser in the process. It is commonly believed that the worms, like the soil, harden from dehydration, but it is, in fact, a natural defense mechanism. Though they might seem to be asleep, estuarine worms remain a danger in the dry season. When the worm&apos;s resting spot is too shallow or a plow digs too deep, farmers risk disturbing a worm in its hibernation. Though the worms may not be as agile or as hungry during this time, they are still dangerous predators.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nEstuarine worms are typically solitary hunters. They reproduce parthenogenetically, and thus have little need for contact with others of their kind. Estuarine worms reproduce rarely, but birth large numbers of offspring when they do. Most of the spawn, however, are eaten by other predators long before they reach full size. When multiple worms are found together (usually because of lower-than-normal floodwater), only the alpha worm uses its bioluminescence. This sign of dominance also keeps potential prey from being drawn to multiple light sources.\n\nSeveral cults in Osirion keep estuarine worms as sacred beasts in their secret temples. Worshipers of both Lamashtu and Rovagug believe it was their respective god who birthed these worms. Members of the Old Cults revere estuarine worms for their connection to the star Alboras and the Great Old One who supposedly dwells there. The cultists seek out the worms during the season of shemu, when the worms are less violent and more tractable. A combination of brute force and magic are necessary to find, exhume, and contain these elusive creatures. In captivity, estuarine worms can be made to change form regardless of the season through the application or exclusion of water. The high priests of these cults also know certain spells that can trigger an immediate change. The cultists connect to their god through the worms, offering sacrifices to them and reading omens in their violent squirming. The worms serve as guards against intruders, and can also be used as weapons against the cult&apos;s enemies." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBStrangr" name="Stranglereed" description="An unlikely predator, a stranglereed floats motionless in calm lakes and rivers, patiently waiting for prey to approach before lashing out with two thick tendrils. This horrifically efficient killer gets its name from its uncanny ability to find a victim&apos;s throat with its tendrils. Once the stranglereed has secured its prey, it pulls its victim beneath the surface of the water and directs the victim toward a submerged circular orifice ringed with hundreds of gnashing barbs and thorns. Exceptionally voracious, the stranglereed never stops feeding, and in desperate times, the industrious plant can leave the water briefly in order to hunt on land. These vicious, tenacious plants can even chase down their prey if it breaks free of their strong tendrils. Fortunately, a stranglereed can spend only a limited amount of time out of water. A stranglereed resembles a patch of normal reeds that covers a roughly circular 10-foot diameter area. Submerged in the water under this unassuming vegetation lies a large stalk that ends in its circular mouth. Its length is roughly 8 feet, from its mouth to the tips of its extended reeds. A stranglereed weighs 800 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAbove the calm waters, the stranglereed resembles a large but innocuous reedbed. However, underneath the water&apos;s murk, a large cylindrical stalk bobs in the currents. At the end of this stalk gapes a maw ringed with multiple rows of sharp barbs and thorns capable of shredding the flesh from prey&apos;s bones. Several tendrils grow from under the stranglereed&apos;s stalk to root themselves loosely into the bed of the lake, oasis, or river where it dwells. When the stranglereed detects prey, two tendrils specialized for grasping prey shoot toward their target and attempt to grapple it. The stranglereed lashes its tendrils around its target&apos;s throat and begins to asphyxiate the target. Once its hold is secure, it reels the prey into the water and into its hungry maw. Over centuries of evolution, the stranglereed has developed the ability to extend the range of these lashing tendrils by using an effective, if awkward, lunge.\n\nClose inspection reveals that the stranglereed has multiple eyes that resemble fuzzy nodules running up its many reed stalks. In fact, over a hundred of these tiny orbs can be detected on a typical specimen, and they grant the stranglereed a superior sense of sight.\n\nA stranglereed can venture onto dry land for a limited period of time, which it does when food is scarce or its prey breaks free from its tendrils and flees onto land. Its stalks can change in appearance to match the surrounding flora, a process that takes approximately 24 hours. This enables the plant to blend in with its surroundings whenever it finds itself in a new body of water.\n\nA stranglereed reproduces by expelling seeds that float on air currents much like a dandelion&apos;s fluff. Those that land on dry earth soon die or are scavenged by birds and other small animals. Those that land in water grow into full-sized stranglereed stalks within 1 month. A large body of water can be home to a cluster of stranglereeds if the food supply can meet their demands.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nTypically found in warm, slow-moving water, the stranglereed favors sites that attract large mammals. Watering holes, sluggish rivers, lakes, and especially oases are common feeding spots. While the stranglereed can sustain itself on a diet of fish and other marine life, it seems to prefer the taste of hot blood washing through its gullet. Possessing an animal intellect, the stranglereed quickly adapts to its habitat and soon discovers which creatures it can realistically take down and which are better left alone.\n\nThough stranglereeds can be found throughout Osirion, they pose the greatest danger in and around Tephu, where workers harvest the abundant papyrus reeds for Tephu&apos;s profitable papyrus trade. Papyrus harvesters have taken to prodding growths of papyrus with long poles to determine whether the reeds are in fact mundane plants or dangerous stranglereeds. Some enterprising harvesters even seek out and kill stranglereeds to sell to those who use their pulp in the creation of guardian scrolls.\n\nWhen food is abundant, groups of stranglereeds often entwine their tendrils to create a strong matrix that allows them to work together to tackle much larger prey. This prey is often torn apart and split among the various members of the entwined patch. Entwined stranglereeds seem to release their fluff-like seeds more frequently than their solitary brethren. After spending years in an entwined state, these plants can sometimes merge into one larger creature referred to as a bloated patch." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBLivingS" name="Living Sandstorm" description="Notorious for appearing suddenly out of the roiling tempests of the deep desert, living sandstorms are capable of turning oases and dry farmlands into areas of featureless desert in a shockingly short span of time. When angered, they can scour a whole army down to bits of shining metal and bone buried under feet of shifting sand over the course of one terrible night. Some Osiriani scholars claim that living sandstorms are related to the deadly khamsin storms that scour the desert, and while these creatures are related to elementals, they have nothing to do with the formation of those iconic storms. Living sandstorms are most comfortable when sand is free to flow across the earth. They become agitated whenever creatures make an effort to remove or limit sand in an area, shelter an area from the drifting dust, or alter the weather to reduce or prevent sandstorms. However, they are curious creatures and enjoy experiencing new interactions with beings of other shapes, and are willing to parley when they believe doing so may open the door to a novel diversion-or if a creature simply appears easy to intimidate.\n\nA living sandstorm in its humanoid shape is about 6 feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. In sandstorm form, it expands its form into a pulsing cloud of streaming, loose sand, which gathers into small clumps before being reabsorbed into the storm.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLiving sandstorms are formed from and fed by the unpredictable interaction of raw elemental earth and planar storms or vortices carrying the essence of other planes. These ageless elemental creatures tend to be curious and outgoing when they first discover new places, but are easily frustrated by any kind of restraint. They use their ability to create sand liberally, attempting to pack caves, voids in the Plane of Earth, and other open areas at least half-full of their reddish sand. Because of their origin, they are usually found near gates, portals, and vortices between planes both on the Plane of Earth and on the Material Plane.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nLiving sandstorms dwell in the rare open caverns on the Plane of Earth. On that plane, they are misfits, feared for their affinities for open spaces and howling winds. When conflicts erupt between the powers of the Elemental Planes, they are sometimes recruited to lead strike teams into other planes, as they are adventurous and enjoy discovering open spaces they can fill with their fine, red sand. They are especially valuable when establishing beachheads on planes that have little in the way of earth, because of their ability to create large amounts of sand in relatively short periods of time.\n\nDue to their intrepidness, they readily answer callings to serve summoners so they can visit new places and spread their sand far and wide. If they see an opportunity to do so, they may break free of their calling and explore the wider Material Plane, where they favor desert climes and their nearby regions, and where they are known to contribute to rapid desertification. When marooned on the Material Plane, they are generally restless until they find a way back to the Plane of Earth, but if they know of a route home, they instead explore the nearby area, wandering farther and farther until they lose interest in filling that world with sand and long to move on to a new one." compset="Race">

The eldest and most knowledgeable sphinxes undergo a transformation that allows them to remain undisturbed as they ponder the knowledge they&apos;ve obtained. They turn into creatures of living limestone and grow to tremendous proportions, until they resemble ancient and weathered statues. No longer content with the Material Plane, elder sphinxes cast their consciousnesses out into the Astral Plane and beyond in search of the secrets of the universe, as their mortal hunger for nourishment is replaced by a metaphysical hunger for knowledge.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nScholars claim that some elder sphinxes predate even the Age of Darkness and thus possess firsthand knowledge of the world as it once was, and have learned of the contemporary world only through their astral wandering or during the rare times they walk in their corporeal form. Whatever purpose they served in their youth has long since been forgotten or abandoned, leaving them to pursue more esoteric ambitions. These ancient creatures exist solely to seek out new information and to understand the great mysteries of the universe while their stony physical remains sit idle as time passes them by. In time, these elder sphinxes come to be seen as monuments, and sometimes humanoid cultures gather around them and worship them as idols. Infrequently, elder sphinxes can be coaxed to trade ancient knowledge for more current information or for arcane secrets they have yet to divine from the planes. Finding knowledge or information beyond an elder sphinx&apos;s experiences, however, is as monumental a task as locating one of their kind.\n\nElder sphinxes have little to no contact with other sphinxes. This only occurs when a younger, less powerful sphinx seeks out one of these magnificent specimens to plead for lost knowledge. When elder sphinxes do come into contact with one another, it is always a meeting of great purpose, typically on a matter of such importance that it requires them to share their ancient wisdom and unfathomable lore." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBAmmut" name="Ammut" description="Ammuts are beastly but cunning creatures that consume souls in an attempt to satisfy their insatiable hungers. Few ammuts exist, and those that do wander the vast deserts of Osirion preying on the souls of any creature they can catch. These creatures prefer the taste of thoroughly evil souls or those who have experienced full and complex lives. Ammuts show disdain for creatures of inferior intelligence, but also tend to leave them alone, as they claim their souls are shallow and flavorless. The rarity of ammuts and their nomadic nature makes it difficult to determine how long they live, or even if they age at all. Ammuts are approximately 20 feet long and 9 feet tall at the shoulder. Their rounded and muscular hindquarters makes them denser than would be expected for their size, and ammuts can weigh up to 10 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAmmuts live among the ruins scattered throughout the Osirian deserts, often lairing in abandoned and lost temples of the gods of Ancient Osirion. When outside their lairs, ammuts bury themselves in sand to await the arrival of a suitable meal.\n\nAn ammut is covered in fur ranging from sandy-colored to dark brown, with shorter fur on its back and legs, and a long mane behind its head that covers its shoulders. Its snout and face are layered in reptilian scales that are usually crusted with sand that has partially fused into glass from the heat of its breath.\n\nAmmuts never tire, and once an ammut notices a creature that it considers suitable prey, it&apos;s unrelenting-stalking its prey for hundreds of miles if need be before running it down. These terrifying chases generally don&apos;t last long, as the ammut makes use of a high-pitched scream that dazes prey long enough to allow the beast to catch and devour them. If that tactic fails to net the ammut its meal, it can also use its powerful force of will to dominate its prey, using telepathy to convince the victim to approach. Creatures that try to hide from an ammut using illusions soon find those plans foiled, as ammuts can see through illusions cast by even the most powerful mages. The only way to truly escape an ammut once it selects you as its quarry is to confront and defeat the beast.\n\nFire burns within the core of an ammut, and the heat generated by an ammut&apos;s inner fires can sometimes fuse the sand it passes through into glassy depressions in the desert floor. The best desert guides can recognize these signs (called &#147;blaze bowls&#148;) and avoid areas in which an ammut might be lurking.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nAmmuts are lone predators, and are so rare their social structures (if any) and method of reproduction are unknown. No live specimen has ever been caught for observation, because the inner fires of the ammut consume the creature&apos;s body quickly upon its death, leaving little to be studied besides ash and brittle glass formed from fused sand. Every so often, a peddler in the markets of Eto or Shiman-Sekh will claim to possess a rare piece of an ammut&apos;s body (such as one of its teeth or an eye) that they try to sell to foreigners and treasure hunters. Most native Osirians know to ignore such claims, but outsiders may be gullible enough to buy the extremely expensive fakes as souvenirs. One of the few things peddled in these markets that actually has a connection to ammuts are pieces of their blaze bowls. Sometimes brave explorers come across one of these glassy depressions, and remain in the area long enough to try to carefully remove the fused sand in one whole piece. More often than not these efforts are fruitless, as the brittle glass often crumbles if mishandled.\n\nBecause ammuts are so rare, the libraries of Osirion contain records of only two-dozen confirmed sightings, though it&apos;s likely that many more encounters ended with no one left to report the event. Osirian scholars have estimated, based more on reports of the telltale blaze bowls than of actual ammuts, that there are perhaps twenty to thirty of the creatures roaming the vast wasteland between the Junira River and the River Sphinx, though a single sighting near the Ruins of Tumen suggests the ammuts are not confined between those waterways. No record of a peaceful encounter with an ammut exists, suggesting that they have no interest in anything other than feeding on the souls of those who cross their paths.\n\nThe origin of the ammuts is shrouded in mystery, though it&apos;s thought that they descended from a single creature of their kind that was more powerful than all existing ammuts combined. This mythical ammut is sometimes referred to in Ancient Osiriani scrolls where it has the position of judging the souls of the dead-a role already assumed by Pharasma. Because of this conflict, scholars argue about the creatures&apos; true origin.\n\nThough it is generally agreed that ammuts migrated to Golarion from another plane long ago, many scholars disagree on the exact planar origin. Some scholars claim that ammuts are perhaps descended from a race of devils, while others claim the lineage stems from the divs. The most logical association of a fiendish origin is rooted in daemonkind. That ammuts are connected with souls and have the ability to utterly consume them certainly lends to this hypothesis." compset="Race">

Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round. The amount and type of damage varies and is given in the creature&apos;s statistics. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while the creature that did the swallowing does not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 the creature&apos;s total hit points), or it can just try to escape the grapple.

Some of these beings exist simultaneously in two worlds, half in the emptiness of space and half in some other dimension of which mortals dare not even dream. The neshmaals are such a race, aliens of such inscrutable malice and hunger that even most other denizens of the darkness avoid them. These strange beings view the humanoids populating the universe as either cattle to eat or playthings to manipulate like marionettes.\n\nA neshmaal&apos;s body is formed of a tangle of writhing tentacles that is roughly 9 feet across. As they are incorporeal outside of their home dimension, the creatures have no weight.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nNeshmaals are incorporeal in the Material Plane. They may be corporeal in their own dimension, but no one has journeyed there and returned to verify this. In the Material Plane, neshmaals spend most of their time in the empty darkness of deep space, where extremes of temperature are commonplace and the varieties of weather found on terrestrial worlds have no impact on these strange creatures. Due to this exceptional form of adaptation, neshmaals can be found virtually anywhere. Neshmaals have no need to breathe, so they are unaffected by inhaled poisons and can dwell underwater without restriction. Despite their many immunities and resistances, they are especially vulnerable to damage from sonic attacks, perhaps because they are accustomed to the silence of the void. Since outsiders don&apos;t normally need to eat, the neshmaals&apos; ravenous hunger for the energy of all living creatures suggests that they manifest in the Material Plane only to gain sustenance. Neshmaals satisfy this hunger by draining the life force from living creatures, though it&apos;s assumed they also derive some nourishment from psychic energies from sentient beings as well, fear in particular.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nNeshmaals, which exist at once on the Material Plane and in a dimension of their own, seem to have no interest in congress with other species, though they speak passable Aklo and possess telepathy. What little information exists about their culture is contradictory, though their endless appetites for raw life force support the theory that they are scavengers created by the Great Old Ones to cleanse worlds of sentience.\n\nNeshmaals are occasionally found in the service of much more powerful otherworldly beings from the Dark Tapestry. Some scholars believe these creatures to be agents of the mysterious Dominion of the Black. This is a reasonable assumption, as they have similar inscrutable methodologies to the creatures that make up the Dominion, and neshmaals have been recorded in texts that deal with various creatures that make up the Dominion of the Black. The role neshmaals might play in that dark hierarchy is unclear.\n\nHumanoid conjurers on the Material Plane have summoned these inscrutable beings to gain knowledge of the inky depths of the universe and beyond, though doing so places the conjurer&apos;s sanity in terrible jeopardy. The process is maddening, and the conjurer&apos;s safety is not diminished once the neshmaal is called to service. Attempting to obtain the service of a neshmaal is very dangerous, unless such service aligns with the neshmaal&apos;s goals, and only the mad can discern the nature of those goals. Neshmaals constantly modify the original agreement, and they often manipulate those they serve. A neshmaal&apos;s most common request is a never-ending chain of humanoids for them to drain of their life force.\n\nIt&apos;s unusual to find more than a few of these otherworldly creatures in one place, making it difficult to calculate their total numbers. Neshmaals employ telepathy to communicate with others of their kind; while doing so, they intertwine their tentacles and tendrils in a manic, lascivious embrace. The book Secrets of the Dreaming Dark (which is thankfully rare) provides the ritual to summon neshmaals. The tome also reports that neshmaals are somehow connected to, seeking, or fleeing from something cryptically referred to as the &#147;Black Alluvion Dream.&#148; Even occult scholars, astronomers, and other seekers of secrets tend to steer clear of this esoteric and dangerous topic, given that those few who have pursued its study now occupy carefully guarded cells in asylums across the Inner Sea Region." compset="Race">

  <thing id="rCBUlunat" name="Festering Ulunat" description="Ulunat&apos;s carapace towers above Sothis, creating what is now known as the Black Dome. The most exclusive part of the city, the Black Dome shields its district from the sun&apos;s blazing heat and the desert&apos;s blistering sandstorms. Beneath the Black Dome sit palaces and monuments, the most important of which is the seat of Sothis&apos;s government and the home of the Ruby Prince.\n\nThe stories from the beginning of the First Age of Osirion claim that Azghaad killed Ulunat-some even say that he achieved this feat with the divine help of Nethys-but the truth is that the Spawn of Rovagug are unkillable. After a lengthy and dangerous battle, Azghaad banished Ulunat to a pocket realm beneath the place where its bloated shell still stands. In this realm, under the oldest and largest settlement in Osirion, Ulunat sleeps.\n\nBefore this ancient conflict, the great beast emerged from the Pit of Gormuz and thundered across Golarion. As Ulunat neared what is now Sothis, cultists of Rovagug channeling the power of raw chaos in a massive ritual- chanting cacophonous praises to the Rough Beast- opened a direct link between Ulunat and Rovagug. Empowered by this divine connection, Ulunat grew to an immense size and charged across the land, trampling everything in its path.\n\nNow, thousands of years later, the Unholy First has begun to stir in its prison. Numerous past attempts to free the Unholy First have failed, and most of these were hidden from the public and Osirion&apos;s official history in hopes that the proper method for freeing Ulunat would remain unknown. However, this doesn&apos;t stop cultists and doomsayers from trying to bring back the terrible beast.\n\nBolstered by recently discovered information, a cult of Rovagug has created a key that they know can unlock Ulunat&apos;s prison. Using this key, they perform a ritual that breaks open Azghaad&apos;s prison and unleashes Festering Ulunat on Osirion once more. Fueled by their chaotic power and Rovagug&apos;s fury, the beast erupts from hibernation, destroying everything beneath the Black Dome. Once it reaches the bounds of its ancient carapace, it effectively molts, bursting fully formed from its old shell into Sothis.\n\nNewly freed from its prison and without the direct connection to Rovagug it possessed thousands of years ago, the reborn Ulunat is not the same monstrosity that Azghaad defeated long ago. This beast is much smaller, closer to its original size when it crawled from the Pit of Gormuz. However though the creature may be smaller, Ulunat is still just as dangerous as it ever was.\n\nUlunat isn&apos;t terribly bright, and destruction is its only goal. The beast clamors through the city, walking in circles for a few circuits of the metropolis before f ixing on a southward trajectory. The Khopeshman of Sothis rallies the best of the Risen Guard and the Eyes of Sothis to fight against Ulunat, but knowing that simple weapons won&apos;t bring the monster down, he orders them to help save as many citizens as possible. Thousands of Sothis&apos;s citizens perish in the first minutes of this rampage, and only the world&apos;s greatest heroes are capable of stopping Ulunat&apos;s unbridled destruction. If the PCs come to the aid of Sothis and banish Ulunat from Golarion-or even discover a way to permanently destroy it-they are assured a high place in the city and eternal recognition in the records of Osirion." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">
