  <thing id="rcMPSGGDsV" name="Distant Viewing" description="You are able to see places not in your line of sight. \n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: You may make Perception checks to view an area beyond your line of sight as if you were present at that area. This allows you to see things beyond cover (such as on the other side of a door), but does not make you any more likely to spot hidden or concealed objects or creatures. Despite being called distant viewing, this psychic ability can also transmit information about sounds, smells, textures, and even taste - any sensory detail the psychic could pick up if present.\n\nTo make a Perception check in an area you must select a location that is obvious (on the other side of a door, around the corner, inside a carriage, 40 feet north, and so on), or one you are familiar with. Your Perception check takes a penalty based on the amount of material between you and the area you wish to view, the distance to that location and the time you take to use your ability, as outlined in Table: Distance Viewing Penalties. For spotting things that are out in the open and obvious, a DC 0 check is successful (see the Perception skill description in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook for more information on Perception DCs).\n\nIf you have both distant viewing and psychometry and have successfully identified the psychic frequency of an object (or creature that touched that object), you can attempt to view places strongly associated with the object or its owner. This is risky, however, as you do not know how far away such a location is, and thus don&apos;t know what penalties you are taking to your distant viewing check. See psychometry for more information on learning psychic frequencies.\n\nAny defense that is effective against, or prevents, magic scrying is also effective against, or prevents, distant viewing." compset="RaceCustom" summary="You are able to see places not in your line of sight." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="rcMPSGGDow" name="Dowsing" description="As a full-round action, you can attune yourself to recognize the psychic vibrations of a natural material, allowing you to know when it is present, and sometimes even to find it when it isn&apos;t nearby. \n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: You can make Survival checks to determine if a naturally-occurring material is present (within a radius equal to your Wisdom score in feet), and to track down the exact location of such substances. The DC of this check is based on the type of material, as determined by Table: Dowsing Base DCs. For every foot of wood, inch of stone or earth, or 1/6th of an inch of metal between you and the material, the DC is increased by +1. If a material is not nearby but you beat the required DC to find it by 10 or more, instead of determining its location, you gain a vague idea what direction the largest concentration of the material is within one mile.\n\nYou  may  also  use  this  ability  to  find  edible materials, follow the psychic vibrations left by creatures that were once at your location, and avoid dangerous natural hazards. This allows you to make a dowsing check in place of a Survival check to track creatures, get along in the wild, and avoid natural hazards such as quicksand. (This is most useful for characters that gain bonuses to psychic skill checks, or that use an intuition or psychic power check in place of the normal skill check dowsing calls for.)" compset="RaceCustom" summary="You can attune yourself to recognize the psychic vibrations of a natural material" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="rcMPSGGMes" name="Mesmerism" description="You can send false information into the mind of a target, causing it to believe something that isn&apos;t true. \n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: This allows you to make Bluff checks to deceive (rather than to feint or send secret messages) at range against a target you can see. You do not have to speak to, or share a language with, your target though it must have an Int of 2 or greater. Using mesmerism is a standard action, regardless of how complex a lie you attempt to convince your target is true.\n\nIf you attempt to convince a target of the falsehood of something it can directly observe (such as claiming you are holding a banana, rather than a gun), the target may choose to resist your Bluff check with a Perception check (rather than a Sense Motive check). You suffer normal penalties for attempting to convince your target of unlikely or impossible lies, but gain no bonus for having proof of your lie. Mesmerism has no obvious visible or audible effects. \n\nSomeone observing you may make a Perception check opposed by your mesmerism check to realize you are intently focused on your target (and if your target begins acting in an obviously unusual way, such observers may conclude you are responsible, even if they do not know exactly how).\n\nWhile you are not dependent on language, trying to use mesmerism on a radically different mind is difficult. When attempting mesmerism on a creature of a different type than you are, you suffer a -4 penalty.\n\nIf your Bluff check against a target is successful, it is unaware that you influenced it (though a target can later contemplate its behavior, and how you benefited from it, and conclude you are somehow responsible).  If your Bluff check fails, the target makes a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 your total Bluff bonus) to realize you are somehow attempting to alter its perception of reality.  On a failed check, you suffer no penalty to future efforts to use mesmerism to Bluff the target." compset="RaceCustom" summary="You can send false information into the mind of a target" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="rcMPSGGMOM" name="Mind Over Matter" description="You can manipulate the physical world by extending your aura to move objects without touching them. \n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: The maximum Strength value you can apply with mind over matter is equal to your Wisdom score -18. If this results in a value of 0 or less, divide the carrying capacity of a 1 Strength by the number of points your total is less than 1 to determine your mind over matter carrying capacity.\n\nThe  range  of  mind  over  matter  is  very short,  limited  to  the  range  of  your  normal melee attacks. When determining what you can do with mind over matter carrying capacity, assume you can accomplish anything you could accomplish with a single hand. In many cases, this is limited to bending cutlery and moving very light objects (such as keys) short distances.\n\nYou can extend the range of mind over matter by making a Wisdom check with a DC of 10 + total range in feet. A failed check results in psychic backlash (see Psychic Backlash). You can also use mind over matter to replace the tools required to make a skill check, allowing you to use such skills as Disable Device and Heal without penalty.

  <thing id="rcMPSGGPmt" name="Psychometry" description="You can touch an object and pick up echoes of psychic vibrations left by creatures that have interacted with it. \n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: This allows you to make an Appraise check to learn information about the object as if you had made an appropriate Knowledge check with the same total. If you exceed the DC of this check by 10, you learn the object&apos;s psychic frequency (useful if you also have Distant Viewing, see above). You can also determine the object&apos;s true value and if it has any magic properties (as the rules for the Appraise skill).\n\nYou may also gain information about creatures that have been in physical contact with the object. You apply your psychometry check to the first creature you can gain information about (see below). If you gain all the information possible about that creature, reduce your total check by 5 and apply it to the second creature you might gain information about (see the Table: Psychometry Information).\n\nWhen determining what creatures you gain information about, who you learn about, and in what order, is determined by their relationship to the object. You first gain information about the last creature to be seriously injured (down to 50% or less of its hit point total) when in contact with the item. If you make a check by enough to learn all the details you can about that person (or if no one was ever badly damaged when touching the object), you then gain information on the creature who has been in contact with it the longest over the past year. Then whoever touched the object last. Then whoever created it.\n\nThen anyone else with a relationship to the object, in an order determined by the GM. Making multiple checks against the same object does not give you new information - whatever you pick up on your first psychometry attempt represents all the psychic impressions you can pick up. However if you successfully determine a creature&apos;s psychic frequency, you recognize that creature&apos;s impression on any other object it has touched. You can also attempt to make a distant viewing check to gain a glimpse of that creature (see Distant viewing).\n\nAny defense that is effective against, or prevents, magic scrying is also effective against, or prevents, psychometry." compset="RaceCustom" summary="You can touch an object and pick up echoes of psychic vibrations left by creatures" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="rcMPSGGTrf" name="Thought Transference" description="You can read the thoughts and emotions of others, and broadcast your own thoughts directly into the minds of your targets. \n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: This allows you to make certain skill checks at range against a target you can see. You may use thought transference to make Bluff checks to send secret messages (rather than to feint or lie) and Intimidate checks to influence attitude (rather than demoralize). You do not have to speak to, or share a language with, your target, though it must have an Int of 4 or greater. If you succeed at a Bluff check to send a secret message, you may also read a reply the target intentionally sends back to you. If you succeed at an Intimidate check, and wish the target to give you information, you receive the information in your mind with no need for the target to speak.\n\nUsing thought transference is a standard action. You are limited to what could reasonably be said in a single round of normal conversation with each use of this ability.\n\nWhile you are not dependent on language, trying to use thought transference on a radically different mind is difficult. When attempting thought transference on a creature of a different type than you are, you suffer a -4 penalty.\n\nIf you use thought transference to pass secret messages, the target is aware you are the source of the messages if your effort succeeds, and notices nothing if it fails. If you use thought transference to influence attitude, the target receives a Will save (DC 10 +1/2  your total Intimidate bonus) regardless if your effort is successful or a failure. On a failed check the target just has a vague sense of  unease,  and  its later attitude toward you does not change,nor do you take penalties for future attempts to intimidate it (though a target can later contemplate its behavior, and how you benefited from it, and conclude you are somehow responsible). If the save succeeds the target realizes you are somehow &quot;in its mind,&quot; and reacts to you as it would if you had made a conventional Intimidate check (even if it cannot explain exactly what you have done)." compset="RaceCustom" summary="You can read the thoughts and emotions of others" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="cMPSGGTkMs" name="Take Measure" description="The core ability of a profiler is to take the measure of a person to size them up and make a rational deduction based on training and experience-of how that person is going to react to specific situations and suggestions. Taking measure only works on creatures with an Int of 6 or greater; creatures with a lower Int are too simple and unpredictable for the ability to function.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: To take measure of a creature, the profiler must make a Sense Motive check, with a DC of 11 + target&apos;s Bluff bonus, or 11 + target&apos;s HD (whichever is higher). This check is made in secret by the GM, who simply informs the profiler of success or failure.\n\nTaking a creature&apos;s measure normally requires at least one minute and the ability to see, hear, and understand the creature while it interacts in a conversation. If the profiler can&apos;t meet all three of those requirements he may still attempt to take measure of the creature, but his Sense Motive check suffers a -5 penalty.\n\nOnce a profiler has taken measure of a creature, he gains a +2 bonus to all Wisdom and Charisma-based ability and skill checks regarding that creature and has a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the creature. This increases to +4 to Wisdom and Charisma skill and ability checks and +2 to attack rolls at 6th level, and again to +6 to Wisdom and Charisma skill and ability checks and +3 to attack rolls at 12th level and finally to +8 to Wisdom and Charisma skill and ability checks and +4 to attack rolls at 16th level. A profiler can take measure once per day, plus one additional time for every five levels of profiler. Failed attempts to take measure do not count against this number. Once he fails a Sense Motive to take measure of a creature, he cannot attempt to do so again for 24 hours. Once he successfully takes measure of a creature, he maintains these bonuses for 24 hours.\n\nAlso, once he has successfully taken measure of a creature, he can attempt to do so again in the future as a standard action without taking the normal -5 penalty." compset="CustomSpec" summary="Take the measure of a person to size them up and make a rational deduction" uniqueness="unique">

This allows you to see things beyond cover (such as on the other side of a door), but does not make you any more likely to spot hidden or concealed objects or creatures. Despite being called distant viewing, this psychic ability can also transmit information about sounds, smells, textures, and even taste - any sensory detail the psychic could pick up if present.\n\nTo make a Perception check in an area you must select a location that is obvious (on the other side of a door, around the corner, inside a carriage, 40 feet north, and so on), or one you are familiar with. Your Perception check takes a penalty based on the amount of material between you and the area you wish to view, the distance to that location and the time you take to use your ability, as outlined in Table: Distance Viewing Penalties. For spotting things that are out in the open and obvious, a DC 0 check is successful (see the Perception skill description in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook for more information on Perception DCs).\n\nIf you have both distant viewing and psychometry and have successfully identified the psychic frequency of an object (or creature that touched that object), you can attempt to view places strongly associated with the object or its owner. This is risky, however, as you do not know how far away such a location is, and thus don&apos;t know what penalties you are taking to your distant viewing check. See psychometry for more information on learning psychic frequencies.\n\nAny defense that is effective against, or prevents, magic scrying is also effective against, or prevents, distant viewing.\n\n{b}Action{/b}: Distant Viewing attempts take 10 minutes to initiate.

The results of the check persist for 10 minutes afterward.\n\n{b}Try Again{/b}: Yes, but still only once per day." compset="Ability" summary="You can read the thoughts and emotions of others" uniqueness="unique">
