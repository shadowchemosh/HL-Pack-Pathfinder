  <thing id="cPUSacBot" name="Sacred Bottles" description="Starting at 2nd level, bottlers gain a number of sacred bottles equal to half their class level. These bottles are treated as potion bottles for the purpose of being attacked or destroyed, but gain additional hardness equal to half the bottler&apos;s class level. The bottles can appear in any shape or size, but always share the same rules. If any of the bottles are destroyed, new ones are created to replace them the next time the bottler would normally regain power points after resting. If a sacred bottle leaves the bottler&apos;s possession, it breaks and becomes useless. A bottle with a captured haunt has an obvious visible effect (filled with smoke, glowing green, etc.). As the bottler gains in power, this ability improves.\n\nAt 5th level, the bottler may, as a standard action, break one of his sacred bottles to spontaneously re-create a haunt from memory. Each of the haunts presented below are used as a part of the bottler&apos;s training, and he is assumed to have experienced and survived them (that is, he may create them freely with this ability). The area of the haunt is centered on the bottler, and he may automatically control the haunt each round as long as he has at least one empty sacred bottle remaining. This haunt lasts for a number of rounds equal the bottler&apos;s Charisma modifier, or until destroyed (whichever happens first). This is a supernatural effect. While the haunt is active, the area changes subtly to match the haunt&apos;s effects (a ghostly alleyway for the choking hands haunt, or a long hallway for the orbs haunt, for example). This has no in-game effect, and vanishes as soon as the haunt is destroyed.\n\n{i}Slamming Portal:{/i} LE haunt (doors or shutters in 5-ft. radius); ML 1; Perception DC 10 (to see a portal closing); hp 2; tricked by {i}hide from undead{/i}. The haunted door or window slams shut, held fast as if by {i}hold portal{/i} for 1 minute or until the haunt is destroyed.\n\n{i}Orbs:{/i} CE haunt (10-ft.-by-20-ft; hallway); ML 2; Perception DC 10 (to notice pulsating, glowing orbs); hp 4; destroyed by {i}slow{/i} effect. This swarm of glowing orbs, ranging in size from tiny peas to large melons, cause witnesses to be subjected to the effects of scare (DC 13). The bottler must be at least 6th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Cold Spot:{/i} NE persistent haunt (15-ft. radius); ML 3; Perception DC 10 (to notice sudden temperature drop); hp 13; damaged by fire. When the area is entered, the temperature immediately drops to freezing, drawing warmth from the living. This duplicates {i}chill touch{/i} (DC 11), automatically affecting all creatures in the area for each round they remain. A bottler must be at least 7th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Choking Hands:{/i} CE persistent haunt (15-ft.-by-30-ft.; alleyway); ML 4; Perception DC 20 (to see coalescing vapor); hp 18; tricked by {i}hide from undead{/i}. This spirit manifests as a pair of spectral skeletal hands, latching on to the throats of the victim. This +4 touch attack duplicates a {i}vampiric touch{/i} each round, adding the temporary hit points to the haunt&apos;s hp total. A bottler must be at least 8th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Mad Monk:{/i} CN haunt (25-ft.-radius; churchyard); ML 5; Perception DC 20 (to hear pouring liquid); hp 10. A robed monk materializes, offering a gold chalice to a target in the area. There is a 50% chance that the liquid within functions as a {i}cure critical wounds{/i} - otherwise, it functions as the {i}poison{/i} spell (DC 16). The haunt ends as soon as one creature drinks from the chalice. The bottler must be at least 9th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Baleful Apparition:{/i} CE haunt (30-ft.-by-30-ft.; chamber); ML 6; Perception DC 18 (to feel an ominous presence); hp 12. Victims of the haunt are subject to disturbing, phantasmal images. These unnatural sights and sounds cause all in the area to be affected as if by {i}fear{/i} (DC 16). A bottler must be at least 10th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Deathless Defenders:{/i} CE haunt (30-ft. radius); ML 7; Perception DC 20 (to see spectral image of a decayed regiment); hp 14; tricked by {i}hide from undead{/i}. Appearing as regiments of spectral, decaying warriors, these haunts charge those in the area bearing rusting arms and armor. These attacks mimic the effects of {i}eyebite{/i} (DC 19). The bottler must be at least 11th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Ghastly Whispers:{/i} CE haunt (up to 40-ft. radius); ML 8; Perception DC 20 (to hear whispers growing louder); hp 16. Those in the area can hear a faint whispering, growing louder and louder. This maddening disorientation functions as an {i}insanity{/i} (DC 20). The bottler must be at least 12th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Ectoplasmic Miasma:{/i} CE persistent haunt (30-ft. radius; ethereal cloud); ML 9; Perception DC 15 (to see congealing mist); hp 40; tricked by {i}hide from undead{/i}. Dozens of spectral visages appear, howling and twisting, in the fog, their limbs and faces mangled. These figures pass through those in the area, duplicating both {i}solid fog{/i} and {i}acid fog{/i} (DC 17), except that they deal untyped damage. The bottler must be at least 13th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Headless Horseman:{/i} CE persistent haunt (10-ft.-by-50. ft.; bridge); ML 10; Perception DC 20 (to hear the galloping of a phantom horse); hp 45. This haunt appears as a headless, mounted rider, wearing ancient armor, head swinging from the saddle of its rotting horse. Every round, it gallops by, attacking a target within the area as if with {i}mage&apos;s sword{/i} (with a +16 attack bonus). The bottler must be at least 14th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Spectral Carriage:{/i} CE haunt (15-ft.-by-60-ft.; roadway); ML 11; Perception DC 22 (to hear galloping hooves); hp 22. Appearing as a translucent horse-drawn carriage, full of laughing ghosts in rotting finery, this haunt swerves to run down all the area. This functions as a {i}clenched fist{/i} (+25 attack), affecting every target in the area. The bottler must be at least 15th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Hungry Earth:{/i} CE haunt (80-ft.-radius; graveyard); ML 12; Perception DC 29 (to feel the ground shift); hp 24. Deep, yawning graves open in the earth beneath each target in the area, functioning as an {i}earthquake{/i} cast on open ground (DC 15 or 20). Victims that fall into the grave are buried as normal until they free themselves or are recovered. The bottler must be at least 16th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Gjenganger:{/i} CE persistent haunt (up to 65-ft. radius); ML 13; Perception 28 (to see the haunt becoming corporeal); hp 58. The gjenganger manifests corporeally, appearing as a twisted, stunted double of a target in the area. However it appears, the haunt relies on its &quot;dead man&apos;s pinch&quot;, a +13 melee touch attack that causes bubonic plague, as if by {i}contagion{/i} (DC 16). The bottler must be at least 17th level to use this haunt.\n\n{i}Keening Suicides:{/i} CE haunt (60-ft.-radius; tower); ML 14; Perception DC 30 (to hear distant, plummeting screams); hp 28. This haunt appears with the awful wails of those leaping to their deaths from high atop the tower. These wails overwhelm the living, filling them with lethal sorrow. This functions as a {i}wail of the banshee{/i} (DC 23) to all within the area. The bottler must be at least 18th level to use this haunt." compset="ClSpecial" summary="You can capture or create haunts with your bottles.">

This doll is linked to his eidolon, and is required for many of the eidolon&apos;s abilities. The hounforge may manifest psion powers with a range of touch on his eidolon from any range, as long as he is holding his spirit doll.\n\nThe spirit doll can be attacked and destroyed - any damage dealt to it is also dealt to the eidolon. The spirit doll has a hardness of 2, hit points equal to one half of the eidolon&apos;s normal maximum hit points, and heals any damage dealt to it whenever the hounforge would normally recover power points. If the spirit doll is destroyed, the eidolon is also destroyed and sent back to its home plane. In this case, the doll must be rebuilt, following the above rules, before the eidolon can be summoned again. However, while the spirit doll is being held by the hounforge that created it, it gains a measure of psychic protection, increasing its hardness by an amount equal to twice the hounforge&apos;s class level.\n\nIn addition, the eidolon and the spirit doll must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%.

He gains an eidolon, which functions exactly as if the hounforge was a summoner of half his class level (minimum 1), including evolution pool, except that it must be of the host base form. But, this is not without cost. A hounforge may never gain a psicrystal for any reason. If he already had a psicrystal, it immediately ceases functioning and becomes useless.\n\nWhenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, the hounforge can sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. The hounforge may only activate this ability while he is holding his spirit doll.\n\nAt 2nd level, while the hounforge maintains psionic focus, he may spend a standard action to heal his eidolon. The hounforge must be able to see the eidolon, and must be holding his spirit doll The hounforge may spend any number of power points, up to his class level, and the eidolon heals that many hit points. This is a supernatural effect.\n\nAt 4th level, while the hounforge maintains psionic focus, he may, as a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon. This enables him to hear, see, smell, taste, and feel everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his class level. There is no range to this effect, but the eidolon and the hounforge must be on the same plane, and the hounforge must be holding his spirit doll. The hounforge can end this effect as a free action. This is a supernatural effect.\n\nAt 8th level, the hounforge imbues his eidolon with the essence of the spirit. The eidolon&apos;s natural attacks count as if they had the {i}ghost touch{/i} special weapon property. In addition, the hounforge may psionically focus his eidolon, just as if it were a psicrystal and he possessed the Psicrystal Containment feat. He may use this focus as his own as long as the eidolon is within arm&apos;s reach, or if he is currently holding his spirit doll.\n\nAt 14th level, twice per day as a swift action, the hounforge may expend his psionic focus while holding his spirit doll to summon his eidolon. This functions exactly as if the hounforge had summoned the eidolon normally, except that it only remains with the hounforge for one minute per class level, and can be dismissed at any time as a standard action. While summoned in this way, the eidolon cannot touch any creature warded by {i}protection from evil{/i} or a similar effect if its alignment matches the effect, and your eidolon can be sent back to its home plane by {i}dispel magic{/i}.\n\nIf the hounforge summons his eidolon in this way while it is already on his plane, it is instead teleported adjacent to the hounforge. The hounforge may summon his eidolon in this way even if it has been returned to its home plane due to damage. This is a supernatural effect.\n\nAt 20th level, the hounforge reaches the peak of attunement with the spirit. His eidolon is immune to mind-affecting effects, other than those originating from the hounforge. In addition, once per day, when the eidolon successfully hits an incorporeal enemy, that enemy must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 20 + the hounforge&apos;s Intelligence modifier) or become shaken and lose the incorporeal ability for 1 minute.
