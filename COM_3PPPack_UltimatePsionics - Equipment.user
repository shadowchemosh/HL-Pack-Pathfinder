The basic psicrystal\nstaff grants minimal ability to the psionic character&apos;s\npsicrystal; however, every psicrystal staff can be\ncustomized, modified, and upgraded by the addition\nof setting stones. Each stone grants different abilities\nto the psionic character who uses the staff to carry his\npsicrystal. Of course, many psionic characters already\ncarry their psicrystals on staves-only practiced eyes\ncan tell the difference between a decorative setting and\na potent item.\n\nPsicrystal staves have an Armor Class of 7, 10 hit\npoints, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 24.\n\nActivation: Psicrystal staves are activated as a free\naction so long as the psionic character keeps his\npsicrystal docked on the staff&apos;s primary setting. The\nstaff wielder must hold the staff to utilize its power.\nPsicrystals (as well as ancillary setting stones) can\nbe docked for free. As a standard action, the psion can\ndock or release his psicrystal, psionically affixing it to\nthe staff or releasing it; psicrystals with self-propulsion\ncan dock or release themselves, at the direction of the\npsionic character. While docked, the psicrystal (and\nsetting stones, if any) and the staff function as a unit.\nBesides the psicrystal itself, the psicrystal staff can\nhold a total of three additional setting stones. The\nwielder can switch a setting stone with another as a\nstandard action. Setting stones, when mounted, also\nbecome part of the staff.\n\nDocked psicrystals are treated as if their owner&apos;s\nmanifester level is +2 higher than it really is, thus\nunlocking psicrystal potential early. The psicrystal\nmust be mounted for at least 12 consecutive hours to\ninitially gain this benefit, and it loses this benefit if it\nis unmounted for more than 12 hours total in a given\nday. For instance, a 1st-level psion with a psicrystal\nstaff and a mounted psicrystal gains the benefits of a\npsicrystal with the ability to deliver touch powers, +1\nnatural armor, and +1 Intelligence, which is something\nnormally only a psionic character of 3rd to 4th level\ncould expect." compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="iwPUDorje" name="Dorje" description="A dorje is a slender crystal that contains a single power. Each dorje has 50 charges when created, and each charge expended allows one use of that power. A dorje that runs out of charges is just a simple crystal.\n\n{b}Physical Description:{/b} A typical dorje is an elongated crystal of one color (or colorless), between 8 inches and 10 inches long and about ½ inch thick, which can weigh up to ¼ pound. Occasionally, a dorje is decorated with carvings or inscribed runes along a face of the crystal. A typical dorje has AC 7, 7 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 18.\n\n{b}Activation:{/b} Dorjes use the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a dorje is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the power being manifested has a manifesting time longer than 1 standard action, however, it takes that long to manifest the power from a dorje.) The user must have the power on his class list, even if he knows the command thought. Additionally, to activate a dorje, a character must hold it in hand and point it in the general direction of the target or area to be affected.\n\nDorjes are normally created at the minimum manifester level required to manifest the power, and powers that can be augmented are not augmented when stored in a dorje. A dorje&apos;s wielder cannot augment the power contained within the dorje. However, dorjes can be created at a higher manifester level than required to manifest the power. In this case, the dorje that holds an augmentable power is augmented, to the limit of the manifester level and the power&apos;s augmentation maximums, if any. The manifester level of a dorje cannot be more than five higher than the minimum manifester level to use the power it contains.\n\n{b}Note:{/b} After adding this item to your character you will be allowed to select the power of the dorje. Then the cost will be calculated for you. To subtract the gold from your character you will need to go to the Journal tab and put in a negative value for the cost of this dorje. So in example if its a level 1 power the cost would be 750gp. So on the journal tab you would enter -750 and press &quot;Earn&quot;." compset="Wand">

If a psionic character who is not evil studies the work during one week of solitary contemplation, he gains 17 bonus power points and experience points sufficient to place him halfway into the next level of experience. Those who use their powers for evil are punished for their impertinence in defiling the book; they are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone (via the atonement spell) in order to gain any further experience. In addition, an evil psionic reader must make an immediate DC 15 Will save or become permanently confused as if affected by the psychosis power. Only psychic chirurgery or similarly extreme measures can restore sanity.\n\nThe minds of nonpsionic beings are too clouded to benefit from the secrets of this book. To anyone without psionic aptitude, the book&apos;s pages appear to contain nothing but elaborate patterns and drawings of mysterious beings. Once it is read, the book vanishes into the Astral Plane to an unknown destination.

  <thing id="ioPUAnnul" name="Annulus" description="This artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at bay, the Annulus is an artifact that any psionic being should fear. It has been forgotten in the modern age, and merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the planes.\n\nThe Annulus is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring provide an adequate surface for grasping the item.\n\nThe Annulus has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact&apos;s powers immediately flood the wielder&apos;s mind. The wielder can access all powers of the Annulus at manifester level 20th.\n\nThe Annulus generates a continuous catapsi effect within a 100-foot-radius of the wielder (who is unaffected).\n\nThe wielder gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals ability damage.\n\nOnce per day, the wielder can trigger ultrablast as a standard action.\n\nThree times per day, as a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to wrench that affects all creatures in a 50-foot radius.\n\nThe primary power of the Annulus, however, is psionic nullification. Once per year, the wielder can trigger this effect as a special action requiring 10 rounds of continuous concentration to complete. The wielder specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group of psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of light, heat, and sound from the Annulus. Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are nontargeted beings, but any psionic target-regardless of any protection it may possess-disintegrates in a terrific explosion. Nothing is left but floating dust.\n\nDESTRUCTION\nIt is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small group of targets, but nullifying a more powerful being (such as a demigod or greater entity) or another major artifact taxes the Annulus to its limits. If it is used to nullify a more powerful being or another major artifact, the Annulus succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be retrieved by any means." compset="Wondrous" uniqueness="unique">

The crown recharges itself, gaining back 1 power point per day if it currently has fewer than 1,000 points.\n\nDESTRUCTION\nAs a special one-time use of the psicrown, the wearer can channel all the remaining charges in the psicrown into an uncontrolled burst of energy.
