  <thing id="fMInvsAura" name="Invisible Aura" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Spell Focus (illusion), ability to cast invisibility, invisibility sphere, greater invisibility, mass invisibility, or vanish.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you make a creature invisible with invisibility, invisibility sphere, greater invisibility, mass invisibility, or vanish, you also make its magic auras invisible. Efforts to detect creatures that have invisible auras with divination spells that reveal auras (such as detect magic, detect chaos/evil/good/law, and arcane sight) requires the diviner to make a Perception check opposed by the invisible creature&#146;s Stealth check. The invisible creature is allowed to make this Stealth check regardless of cover (or lack thereof) and lighting conditions, but gains no bonus to the check for being invisible. Once the diviner makes a single successful Perception check he can detect the invisible creature&#146;s auras normally for the duration of the divination spell being used.\n\nThis has no impact on divination spells that specifically note they reveal the presence of invisible creatures, such as see invisibility and true seeing." compset="Feat" summary="Your invisibility spells even make magic auras invisible&#133; at least sometimes" uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fMUnsItem" name="Unsensed Item" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Deceitful, ability to cast invisibility, greater invisibility, or mass invisibility.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you target an invisibility, greater invisibility, or mass invisibility spell on an object, it also becomes silent and scentless. In most cases the object is never considered to be making an attack, even if it is a weapon used for an attack (just as a giant that grabs an invisible halfling and uses him as a club is making the attack, and the halfling remains invisible, a human stabbing someone with an invisible sword is the one making the attack, and the sword stays invisible). There are a few exceptions to this &#150; an invisible intelligent magic item might use its magic powers as part of an attack, which would make it visible. An invisible ranged weapon that is used to fire ammunition is making an attack &#150; an invisible crossbow that fires a bolt becomes visible, though an invisible bolt does not become visible for being fired.\n\nThis improved degree of undetectability can grant special bonuses. Using unsensed objects gives you a circumstance bonus to appropriate Bluff checks that use the items. For example, a bard using an unsensed rope to hang from a tree branch would receive a bonus to a Bluff check to convince someone he could fly. A rogue using an unsensed short sword to attack a foe would gain a bonus to make a Bluff check to feint with it. Sleight of Hand checks to conceal unsensed objects also gain bonuses. All these bonuses are equal to the level of the spell used to make the item invisible.\n\nAdditionally, feinting in combat with an unsensed weapon takes less effort than a normal feint. A character with an unsensed weapon can feint in combat as a move action. A character with an unsensed weapon and Improved Feint can feint in combat as a swift action. If a character would somehow normally be able to feint in combat as a swift action (such as under some circumstances when using the Moonlight Stalker Feint feat), he may feint as a free action when using an unsensed weapon.\n\nNone of the benefits of this feat apply against foes able to see invisibility." compset="Feat" summary="You can cast invisibility spells on objects." uniqueness="useronce">

  <thing id="fMFcsInvis" name="Focused Invisibility" description="{b}Prerequisites{/b}: Craft Magic Arms &amp; Armor, ability to cast invisibility, invisibility sphere, greater invisibility, mass invisibility, or vanish.\n\n{b}Benefit{/b}: When you make a creature invisible with invisibility, invisibility sphere, greater invisibility, mass invisibility, or vanish, you may choose to have that invisibility focused through an item worn or held by the creature. The creature is only invisible when wearing or holding the focused item, and action it takes when not wearing or holding the item cannot end its invisible, though the spell&#146;s duration continues to be run even when the focus is not worn. It&#146;s a move action to remove and put away, or pull out and ready, an item being used as an invisibility focus.\n\nFor example, Anushka is a rogue with a half-orc wizard ally Davor, who has invisibility and Focused Invisibility. Anushka wants to sneak up on and kill a guard, then move into a tower. She has Davor cast invisibility on her, focusing it through a ring she is wearing (a common choice). While invisible, she moves up on the guard, and finds a place to hide near him. While concealed, she removes the ring focus, becoming visible, then assassinates the guard. Since she was not wearing her focus, this attack does not end her invisibility spell (though it&#146;s duration continues to run normally while the ring is off). Anushka then puts the ring back on, returns to being invisible, and sneaks into the tower." compset="Feat" summary="You can focus your invisibility spells through objects" uniqueness="useronce">
