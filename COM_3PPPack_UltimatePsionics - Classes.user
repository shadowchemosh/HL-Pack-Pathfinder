He can either form it into a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon. Once chosen, his mind blade stays in this form every time the soulknife forms his mind blade. The light weapon deals 1d6 points of damage, the one-handed weapon deals 1d8 points of damage, and the two-handed weapon deals 2d6 points of damage. All damages are based on a Mediumsized creature wielding Medium-sized weapons; adjust the weapon damage as appropriate for different sized weapons. In all forms, the mind blade has a critical range of 19-20/x2. A soulknife with powerful build or any similar ability forms an appropriately-sized mind blade dealing the size-appropriate amount of damage.\n\nIf the soulknife&apos;s chosen form is a light weapon, he may choose to form two light weapons when forming his mind blade if he so chooses, but he suffers the standard penalties for two-weapon fighting.\n\nRegardless of the weapon form a soulknife has chosen, his mind blade does not have a set damage type. When shaping his weapon and assigning abilities to it, the soulknife chooses whether it will deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. The soulknife may change the damage type of an existing mind blade, or may summon a new mind blade with a different damage type, as a full-round action; otherwise, the mind blade retains the last damage type chosen every time it is summoned.\n\nThe blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and is considered a masterwork weapon.\n\nA soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as if it were a normal weapon. He can also choose his mind blade for feats requiring a specific weapon choice, such as Weapon Focus and Improved Critical.\n\nPowers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind blade. The soulknife can use feats such as Weapon Finesse that work on light weapons with his mind blade, but such feats only work on mind blades in a light weapon form.\n\nEven in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a {i}null psionics field{/i}), a soulknife can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulknife maintains his mind blade for a number of rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again, although the mind blade is treated for all purposes as a non-magical, masterwork weapon while in a place where psionic effects do not normally function. On an unsuccessful attempt, the mind blade vanishes.\n\nAs a move action on her turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize his mind blade while he remains within the psionics-negating effect. He gains a bonus on Will saves made to maintain or form his mind blade equal to the total enhancement bonus of his mind blade (see below).\n\nThe soulknife chooses the appearance of his mind blade, although its shape must reflect the selections the soulknife has chosen: a bludgeoning mind blade would be blunt, slashing would have an edge, etc.\n\n{b}Note:{/b} From the two drop down menus you must pick the type of mind blade (ie Light, one-handed, or two-handed) and its damage type (ie Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing).

Either way, these two are linked in many ways, as the goal of the psion uncarnate is to leave the fetters of the physical corporeal body behind, transforming into a being of pure energy. Over time, the psion uncarnate releases his hold on the physical realm, becoming permanently incorporeal and thus free from the burdens and weaknesses of the physical form. To some, it is the quest for life eternal that leads to this path; for others, it is the wish to be truly free - free from society, constraints created by the physical body, and even the physical worlds themselves. Pure manifesters are the most likely to be drawn to become a psion uncarnate, due to the mastery of psionics needed. Psychic warriors, focusing on using both the body and mind, are very unlikely to walk the path to become a psion uncarnate.\n\n{b}Role:{/b} Psion uncarnates have a tendency to be loners, spending much of their time seeking to become incorporeal creatures.

The fire source is immediately extinguished upon being utilized. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per class level. The fire may be used for one of the following purposes:\n\n{i}Fireworks:{/i} The fire is turned into a blinding display of fireworks; a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights.

  <thing id="cThrall" name="Thrallherd" description="A thrallherd who has just entered the class sends out a subtle psychic call for servants, and that call is answered. Essentially, the character gains something akin to the Leadership feat, but with some important differences. \n\nThose who answer a thrallherd&apos;s call are not referred to as cohorts and followers, but rather as thralls and believers, respectively. They do not appear because they admire the character and want to serve her, but because a hidden psychic resonance connects the thrallherd and her servants.\n \nAs with the Leadership feat, a thrallherd has a Leadership score that determines the highest-level thrall and believers she can attract. A thrallherd&apos;s Leadership score is equal to her character level + her Charisma modifier + her thrallherd level. (Note that her thrallherd level is counted twice.) This score is not affected by any of the modifiers mentioned in the Leadership feat.\n\nAs with the Leadership feat, the called thrall&apos;s level is limited, even if the character&apos;s Leadership score would indicate a higher-level thrall. Unlike with the Leadership feat, the level limit of a thrall is equal to the character&apos;s total level minus 1 (not level minus 2, as is true for cohorts).\n\nA thrallherd cannot take the Leadership feat; if the character already has it, the feat is lost and replaced by this ability; those who were previously cohorts and followers go their separate ways, and those who are more mentally pliable show up later to take up roles as thralls and believers. A thrallherd&apos;s thrall and believers arrive within 24 hours. Lost thralls are replaced within 24 hours. Believers arrive and are replaced at a rate of the thrallherd&apos;s leadership score per day, with the lowest level believers arriving first. If the thrallherd is in a location where thralls and believers cannot reach, none arrive until she moves to a location where she can be reached.\n\nA thrallherd establishes a resonance with his thrall and suffers if the thrall is killed. For 48 hours following the loss of a thrall, a thrallherd suffers one negative level. This negative level may not be healed by any means until 48 hours have passed since the thrall&apos;s death, at which point it fades naturally. Should the thrallherd&apos;s new thrall die while the thrallherd is still suffering a negative level, he acquires an additional negative level, and the duration of any negative levels gained through losing a thrall resets to 48 hours from the time the most recent thrall was lost.\n\nUse the above table instead of the one with the Leadership feat to determine the level of a thrallherd&apos;s thrall and the number of believers of various levels a thrallherd can attract." compset="ClSpecial">

The off-hand mind blade in both configurations can be separately configured in this way.

The dread is the master of fear and terror.\n\n{b}Role:{/b} A dread is an opponent on the battlefield who can turn the bravest of enemies into a sniveling coward with but a touch.

The aegis may manifest the chosen power as many times as his power point pool will allow, but changing to a different power (either within the same power stone, or within another power stone in the repository) requires a move action and flushes the old power from the power stone (so power stones with multiple powers lose one power, but the rest are unaffected; power stones with only a single power are flushed and dissolved). If this customization is lost or removed, any applicable attuned power is flushed from the power stone. The aegis must be at least 3rd level and have the Power Stone Repository customization to select this customization. This customization may be selected a second time beginning at 5th level; doing so allows the aegis to manifest a second 1st-level power from a power stone (either a second stone, or a second power in an already-selected stone). The aegis may freely alternate between these two powers (or any others gained via Harness Power Stone customizations) when manifesting, but trading out either power for a new power flushes out the sacrificed power as usual." compset="RaceCustom">

If a member of the collective is affected by a magical or psionic effect with a duration greater than 1 round, the tactician can echo it onto another member of his collective. To do so, the tactician must first identify the power properly (see the Spellcraft skill description).\n\nEchoing a magical or psionic effect is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity and costs the tactician a number of power points equal to the original effect&apos;s caster or manifester level (whichever applies). As a supernatural ability, a tactician is permitted to spend more power points than his manifester level on this effect.\n\nThe new target must be legal for the effect in question (for instance, if you attempt to echo an unaugmented {i}empathic connection{/i} on a dog, the echo will fail). If the effect allows a saving throw, the new target is entitled to a saving throw when the effect is echoed (same DC as the original power).\n\nOnly the basic effect and augmentation are echoed; metamagic and metapsionic feats do not echo. The echo has all the same decisions made as the original. For example, {i}specified energy adaptation{/i} echoes would guard against the same energy type, while a 5pp {i}empathic connection{/i} (extended duration) could not be echoed as a 5pp {i}empathic connection{/i} (affects aberrations). The echo takes effect at the same caster or manifester level as the originator. When the original ends or leaves the collective, all echoes of it also end. An echo can be dispelled as normal without terminating the original.\n\nA tactician can spend power points to augment this supernatural ability. For every 4 additional power points spent, the echo may reach an additional target.\n\nIf this augment would raise the cost of the echo above the tactician&apos;s manifester level, the echo attempt fails (although he may still attempt to echo it onto a single target).

  <thing id="cPUTacColl" name="Collective" description="A tactician learns to use psionic power to connect willing minds through an internal network that strengthens their psychic bonds. As a standard action, a tactician can join any number of willing targets into his collective equal (up to his limit, see below) . The tactician must have line of sight to each target, each target must have a Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level). The collective can contain up to his key ability modifier or half his tactician level, whichever is higher. The tactician is always considered a member of his own collective, and does not count against this limit.\n\nThe tactician can choose to remove a member as a free action on his turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of range of the collective is automatically removed. If a member enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until that member leaves the field. A member who leaves the collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from being a member. A tactician is aware of the status of his collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling if such a creature is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy below).\n\nA tactician can manifest certain powers through his collective. If a tactician power specifies one or more willing targets (or is harmless) and has a range greater than personal, he can manifest this power on a member of his collective regardless of the range of the actual power.\n\nAll other non-range restrictions still apply. He may also manifest any power with the Network descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or targets. If he is capable of manifesting powers or casting spells from a different class (as is the case for a multiclass tactician), any compatible spell or power with a range greater than touch can also be used through the collective.{br}{br}If a member of the collective dies, the member is removed from the collective and the tactician must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1 power point for every Hit Die of the fallen member and be sickened for an equal number of rounds.{br}{br}At 15th level, a tactician&apos;s collective range is limitless on the same plane as the tactician.{br}{br}At 19th level, a tactician&apos;s collective reaches even across to other planes and dimensions." compset="ClSpecial">

Once every 10 minutes, the soulthief can choose one target to which he has line of sight and, as a full-round action and by expending his psionic focus, begin draining the target of health (12d6 points of empathic damage) which is then transferred to the collective and heals an equal amount of damage. A successful Will save (DC 20 + Wis modifier) negates the effect. Each round, the target may attempt another Will save to negate the effect. The soulthief can maintain concentration to continue the damage each round, for up to one minute. Any damage done after all members of the collective are healed completely instead grants temporary hit points to any member of the collective (soulthief&apos;s choice) for 10 minutes. The soulthief may divide these temporary hit points as he so chooses among members of the collective." compset="ClSpecial">

The astral warrior uses the biped base form of the eidolon, but does not gain any of the natural attacks of the eidolon, nor does it gain any evolution points of its own. Instead, it is created with a masterwork weapon appropriate for its size and is considered proficient with the weapon. The weapon&apos;s damage type (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) is chosen by the ectopic artisan at the time of creation, but the weapon always deals 1d8 points of damage (for a medium sized creature). The astral warrior receives additional iterative attacks as normal if it has a high base attack bonus. The astral warrior&apos;s weapon disappears if it leaves the astral warrior&apos;s possession for more than one minute.\n\nThe ectopic artisan and the astral warrior split the total customization points available to the ectopic artisan, chosen when the ectopic artisan configures his astral suit.\n\nThe ectopic artisan can split his customization points in any ratio between himself and his astral warrior. The ectopic artisan must choose customizations separately for himself and for his astral warrior, although the ectopic artisan does not need to spend 8 hours separately for himself and for his astral warrior. The ectopic artisan can choose to leave customization points to be selected later as normal, choosing them for either himself or his astral warrior by spending one minute as normal. An astral warrior always forms with full hit points, and the astral warrior does not gain any evolutions.\n\nAn astral warrior is a mindless construct.

On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot&apos;s origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.\n\n{i}Stop Bleeding{/i}: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound.

  <thing id="cPUSbMndBt" name="Form Mind Bolt" description="At 1st level, as a move action, a soulbolt can form a semi-solid ranged weapon composed of psychic energy distilled from her own mind. This mind bolt appears inside of or enveloping the soulbolt&apos;s hand.\n\nA soulbolt must choose the form of her mind bolt at 1st level. She can either form it into a short range, medium range, or long range bolt which determines the weapon&apos;s range increment and base damage. Once chosen, her mind bolt stays in this form every time the soulknife forms her mind bolt. The long range bolt form is the smallest of forms and deals 1d6 points of damage and has a 100 ft. range increment. The medium range bolt form deals 1d8 points of damage, with a 60 ft. range increment, and the short range bolt form is the largest and heaviest form and deals 1d10 points of damage with a 20 ft. range increment. A soulbolt adds her Strength modifier to damage rolls when using the mind bolt in the short range form. All damages are based on a Medium-sized creature wielding Medium-sized weapons; adjust the weapon damage as appropriate for different sized weapons. A soulbolt with powerful build or any similar ability forms an appropriately-sized mind bolt dealing the size-appropriate amount of damage. Regardless of form, the mind bolt has a 19-20 critical threat range, has a maximum range of 10 range increments, and is treated as a projectile.\n\nThe form of the soulbolt&apos;s mind bolt also determines how many hands must be used to form and manipulate the mind bolt. If the mind bolt is in long range form, both of the soulbolt&apos;s hands remain free to hold other items such as a shield or a weapon. If the mind bolt is in medium range form, the soulbolt must have at least one hand free to form and manipulate the mind bolt. If the mind bolt is in short range form, the soulbolt must have both hands free to wield and launch the mind bolt.\n\nA soulbolt can wield a buckler without penalty regardless of the form of her mind bolt.\n\nRegardless of the weapon form a soulbolt has chosen, her mind bolt does not have a set damage type. When shaping her weapon and assigning abilities to it, the soulbolt chooses whether it will deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. The soulbolt may change the damage type of an existing mind bolt, or may summon a new mind bolt with a different damage type, as a full-round action; otherwise, the mind bolt retains the last damage type chosen every time it is summoned.\n\nThe bolt can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulbolt can simply create another on her next move action. The moment she relinquishes her grip on her blade, it dissipates (unless she intends to throw it; see below). A mind bolt is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and is considered a masterwork weapon.\n\nA soulbolt can use feats such as Rapid Shot or Precise Shot in conjunction with the mind bolt just as if it were a normal ranged weapon. She can also choose her mind bolt for feats requiring a specific weapon choice, such as Weapon Focus and Improved Critical. Powers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind bolt. The soulbolt can use feats such as Weapon Finesse that work on light weapons with her mind bolt, but such feats only work on mind bolts in a light weapon form, such as using the Mind Daggers blade skill.\n\nEven in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a null psionics field), a soulbolt can attempt to sustain her mind bolt by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulbolt maintains her mind bolt for a number of rounds equal to her class level before she needs to check again, although the mind bolt is treated for all purposes as a non-magical, masterwork ranged weapon while in a place where psionic effects do not normally function. On an unsuccessful attempt, the mind bolt vanishes. As a move action on her turn, the soulbolt can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize her mind bolt while she remains within the psionics-negating effect. She gains a bonus on Will saves made to maintain or form her mind bolt equal to the total enhancement bonus of her mind bolt (see below).\n\nThe soulbolt chooses the appearance of her mind bolt, although its shape must reflect the selections the soulbolt has chosen: a bludgeoning mind bolt would be blunt, slashing would have an edge, etc.\n\nThis ability replaces the Form Mind Blade class feature normally gained by soulknives." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Form a semi-solid weapon composed of psychic energy distilled from your own mind.">

At 3rd level and every odd level thereafter, the mind bolt gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus that she may spend on an actual enhancement bonus or on weapon special abilities. A soulbolt&apos;s maximum enhancement bonus follows the same progression as a soulknife. The soulbolt may (and must, when her total enhancement is higher than her maximum bonus) apply any special ability from the table below instead of an enhancement bonus, as long as she meets the level requirements. A soulbolt can choose any combination of weapon special abilities and/or enhancement bonus that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulbolt&apos;s level, but she must assign at least a +1 enhancement bonus before assigning any special abilities. If the soulbolt shapes her mind bolt into two items, such as using the Mind Daggers blade skill, the enhancement bonus of her mind bolt (if any) is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If this would reduce the enhancement bonus on the mind bolt to 0 and weapon special abilities are applied, the soulbolt must reshape her mind bolt to make the options valid.

At 7th level, the life leech can transfer the exhausted, panicked, nauseated, or paralyzed condition. At 10th level, the life leech can transfer the stunned or unconscious condition (although a creature that receives the unconscious condition from this ability is not reduced to negative hit points by this effect, nor is the original creature brought automatically to positive hit points; such a creature would still have 0 or negative hit points, but would become conscious, stable, and likely given the disabled condition).\n\nIf this ability is used on an unwilling target and the recipient of the effect makes a successful save (see the Unwilling Participant* feat), the creature with the condition being transferred still suffers from the condition.

This ability may only be used on creatures with a Constitution score and may not be used against creatures with a total number of hit dice less than half the life leech’s level.

You must have line of sight to each target, each target must have a Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level). The collective can contain up to your relevant ability modifier (determined by class) or half your level (minimum 1), whichever is higher. If you are a zealot, add the intensity of your zeal to this limit.  You are always considered a member of your own collective, and do not count against this limit. \n\nYou can choose to remove a member as a free action on your turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of range of the collective is automatically removed. If a member enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until the member leaves the field. A member who leaves the collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from being a member. You are aware of the status of his collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling if such a creature is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy below).\n\nIf you are capable of manifesting powers, casting spells, or initiating maneuvers, any compatible spell, power, or maneuver with a range greater than touch can be used through the collective. You may manifest any power with the Network Descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or targets.\n\nIf a member of the collective dies, the member is removed from the collective and you must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1 power point for every Hit Die of the fallen member or be sickened for an equal number of rounds.\n\nAt 15th level, your collective range is limitless on the same plane as you.\n\nAt 19th level, your range reaches even across other planes and dimensions." compset="ClSpecial">

  <thing id="arPUNightC" name="Nightmare Constructor" description="Where most dreads use fear as something to manipulate in creatures, nightmare constructors turn fears into reality. These individuals form horrors created from the energy of nightmares and send them into battle. Enemies of nightmare constructors must truly face their deepest fears when confronted by the creatures created from terror.\n\n{b}Telepathic Lash:{/b} The nightmare constructor gains telepathic lash as a talent. This ability replaces talents.\n\n{b}Horror (Su):{/b} A nightmare constructor is able to form a creature created from distilled fears and nightmares. Creating a horror takes one minute of concentration to complete and the horror remains until dismissed by the nightmare constructor.\nThis horror functions as a summoner’s eidolon using the nightmare constructor’s class level as the summoner level, with the following exceptions. A horror is treated as a construct for the purposes of effects related to its type, such as favored enemy. Commanding a horror is the same as commanding an astral construct. A horror disperses if the nightmare constructor is rendered unconscious or dies.\nThe nightmare constructor can allow his horror to use his terrors, but such uses still count against his daily limit. At 3rd level, the nightmare constructor can also allow his horror to utilize his channel terrors ability.\nThis ability replaces devastating touch.\n\n{b}Reinvigorate Horror:{/b} The nightmare constructor is able to channel his own energy to restore the nightmarish form of his horror. As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the nightmare constructor can touch his horror and restore 5 hit points per power point spent. The nightmare constructor cannot spend more power points on this ability than his manifester level.\n\n{b}Devastating Touch:{/b} At 2nd level, the nightmare constructor’s horror gains the devastating touch ability of a dread, using the nightmare constructor’s class level to determine the total damage dealt. This also allows the nightmare constructor to select terrors that modify\ndevastating touch, but these terrors only apply to the horror’s use of devastating touch. This ability replaces the power known gained at 2nd level.\n\n{b}Fear Surge (Su):{/b} When the horror of a 3rd level or higher nightmare constructor is within 30 ft. of a creature that suffers from the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, the nightmare constructor gains an additional evolution point to spend on the horror. This evolution point only lasts while there is a creature within 30 ft. of the horror with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition. This ability replaces channel terror.\n\n{b}Improved Fear Surge:{/b} At 6th level, when the nightmare constructor gains an evolution point from fear surge, he instead gains two evolution points. This ability replaces the terror normally gained at 6th level.\n\n{b}Greater Fear Surge:{/b} A nightmare constructor of 9th level gains three evolution points when his fear surge is activated. This ability replaces the bonus feat normally gained at 9th level.\n\n{b}Horrific Infusion (Su):{/b} Starting at 11th level, the nightmare constructor can merge with his horror as a standard action. The nightmare constructor wears the horror like translucent and undulating armor. The horror mimics all of the nightmare constructor’s movements, and the nightmare constructor perceives through the horror’s senses and speaks through its voice, as the two are now one creature. The nightmare constructor directs all of the horror’s actions while merged. While merged with his horror, the nightmare constructor uses the horror’s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, but retains his own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The nightmare constructor\ngains the horror’s hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the horror is killed and sent back to its home plane. The nightmare constructor uses the horror’s base attack bonus, and gains the horror’s armor and natural armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores. The nightmare constructor also gains access to the horror’s special abilities and the horror’s evolutions. The nightmare\nconstructor is still limited to the horror’s maximum number of natural attacks. The horror has no skills or feats of its own. The horror must be at least the same size as the nightmare constructor. The horror must have limbs for the nightmare constructor to cast spells with somatic components (should the nightmare constructor have spellcasting ability).\nWhile fused, the nightmare constructor loses the benefits of his armor. He counts both as his original type and as a construct for any effect related to type, whichever is worse for the nightmare constructor. Powers such as dismiss ectoplasm work on the horror,\nbut the nightmare constructor is unaffected. Neither the nightmare constructor nor his horror can be targeted separately, as they are fused into one creature. The nightmare constructor and horror cannot take separate actions. While fused with his horror, the nightmare\nconstructor can use all of his own abilities and gear, except for his armor. In all other cases, this ability functions as the normal horror ability. \nThis ability replaces shadow twin.\n\n{b}Empowered in Fear (Su):{/b} At 11th level, the nightmare constructor’s horror is treated as if under the effect of physical acceleration any time it is within 30 ft. of a creature suffering from either the shaken, frightened, or panicked conditions.\nAt 15th level, the horror is also treated as if under the form of doom power when within 30 ft. of a creature suffering from either the shaken, frightened, or panicked conditions. This effect allows the horror to have more natural attacks than its normal eidolon form limit.\nThis ability replaces twin fear." compset="ClassVary" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="cPUMLCont" name="Mindleap Contingency" description="At 5th level, a body snatcher unlocks the ability to use a unique metapsionic effect known as a mindleap contingency. Powers that specify a single target and can affect the body snatcher’s current form can be made into mindleap contingent\npowers. A mindleap contingent power, once manifest, lies dormant, undetectable and undispellable, for up to five minutes (after which time it fades harmlessly), or until the body snatcher leaves her current body via mind switch (either to return to her original body or to possess another). Immediately after the switch occurs, the mindleap contingency triggers, and the linked power takes effect on the body she was in when she established the contingency. Any choices to be made about the effect must be made when the power is manifest, not when it triggers. Saving throws made against a mindleap contingent power suffer a -5 penalty due to the sudden shift in bodies.\n  For example, Valis the telepath/body snatcher has already mind switched with a subject and is about to shift her mind back to her body. She manifests memory modification (opting to erase the memory of her time in the body) on her current (host) body as a mindleap contingency, after which she returns her mind to her native body. The subject, upon return to its body, is affected by the memory modification power, and must make a Will save (at -5) or be forced to forget the experience.\n  Using this ability is akin to using a metapsionic feat – a body snatcher must expend her psionic focus when establishing a mindleap contingency, and establishing one increases the power’s power point cost by 4." compset="ClSpecial">

She may use the subject’s ranks in Knowledge skills in place of her own, and she learns the command words\nor thoughts for any items the subject has (provided they were known to the subject). Additionally, as a standard action, she may expend her psionic focus to mentally “ask” her newfound memories one question, typically about the subject’s past or personality. She learns the answer to that question to the best of the subject’s knowledge.

In some ways, this is literal truth for a body snatcher, although she tends to see only opportunity. Immediately upon being reduced to -1 hit points or lower, or failing a saving throw against an effect that would kill her, a 6th level body snatcher may expend her psionic focus to manifest true mind switch as an immediate action at the same manifester level she manifests mind switch. She may only target her killer with this effect (thus, if the killer is out of range, this ability is worthless), and the save DC is reduced by 4 due to the desperate nature of this technique. If successful, her mind immediately switches places with\nher killer’s and her old body dies.
