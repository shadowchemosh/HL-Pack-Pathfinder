      This file is designed to hold duplicated spells, feats and abilities that are already done by LW. The reason is to prevent the need of lots of one off Packages being required by the community. So in these cases I have redon the abilities here to give its own copy that can be bootstrapped to prevent load errors.</info_author>

Once this bond is made, a dragonkin cannot form another rider bond until its current rider dies. A dragonkin and its rider can communicate with each other as if they both had telepathy 100 ft. In combat, when a rider is mounted on his dragonkin, both creatures roll initiative separately and treat the highest result as their single result." compset="RaceSpec">
