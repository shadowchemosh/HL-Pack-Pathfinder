  <thing id="puCreaSnd1" name="Deprecated - Create Sound" description="{B}If you see this please remove and re-add the correct Create Sound power to your character{/b}{BR}{BR}You create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound the power creates when manifesting it and cannot thereafter change its basic character.\n\nThe volume of sound created, however, depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per manifester level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise produced can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire lion is equal to the noise from twenty humans.\n\nIf you wish to create a specific message, up to twenty-five\nwords can be created, and those words repeat over and over until the duration expires or the power is dismissed. If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon&apos;s roar), you must succeed on a Bluff check with a +2 circumstance bonus opposed by the listener&apos;s Sense Motive check to avoid arousing suspicion.\n\nCreate sound can be used to bring sounds into existence that you later manipulate by manifesting control sound." compset="PsiPower" summary="Create the sound you desire.">

As a standard action, a zealot can join any number of willing targets into his collective (up to his limit, see below). The zealot must have line of sight to each target, each target must have a Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level). The collective can contain up to his Charisma modifier or half his zealot level (minimum 1), whichever is higher, plus the intensity of his zeal. The zealot is always considered a member of his own collective, and does not count against this limit. \n\nThe zealot can choose to remove a member as a free action on his turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of range of the collective is automatically removed. If a member enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until the member leaves the field. A member who leaves the collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from being a member. A zealot is aware of the status of his collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling if such a creature is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy below).\n\nA zealot can initiate certain maneuvers through his collective. If a zealot maneuver specifies one or more willing targets (or is harmless) and has a range greater than personal, he can initiate this maneuver on a member of his collective regardless of the range of the actual maneuver. All other non-range restrictions still apply. \n\nIf he is capable of manifesting powers, casting spells, or initiating maneuvers from a different class (as is the case for a multiclass zealot), any compatible spell, power, or maneuver with a range greater than touch can also be used through the collective. He may manifest any power with the Network Descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or targets.\n\nIf a member of the collective dies, the member is removed from the collective and the zealot must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1 power point for every Hit Die of the fallen member or be sickened for an equal number of rounds.\n\nAt 15th level, a zealot&apos;s collective range is limitless on the same plane as the zealot\n\nAt 19th level, a zealot&apos;s range reaches even across other planes and dimensions." compset="ClSpecial">
