  <thing id="ruRiverElk" name="Herd Animal, River Elk" description="Powerful and swift land mammals, elk range through the plains, hills, and forests of many wildernesses, in great herds. Related to deer, elk prove important parts of many ecologies, being able to fend off or flee many threats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males- allow them to contend with most of their environment&apos;s dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern. Many humanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions.\n\nMost breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the river elk seen throughout the River Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide.\n\nIn all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nElk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for over 15 years. Physiologically, they&apos;re similar to deer and other grazing animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures. Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources.\n\nBull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong, their kicks proving deadly deterrents against many would-be attackers.\n\nMost breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, many humanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged weapons or great physical prowess.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nDuring most of the year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a harem of as many as 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove deadly. During mating season, cows don&apos;t always produce offspring, though when they do, typically only one or two elk are born.\n\nAfter mating season, cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season. During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make their tell-tale noise (called bugling) it booms and echoes for miles, and females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates.\n\nElk migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons, elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat.\n\nElk are also know to vary widely from region to region. Common in Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, and secluded spots of Numeria, river elks prove larger and heartier than most of their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the comfort with which they enter water, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from any perceived threats." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruThawn" name="Thawn" description="Grotesque nomads native to wretched plains and barren hills, thawns seem to bear the curse of both nature and the divine. Ogre-like in stature and dimwittedness, these monstrously ugly humanoids bear fold upon fold of sagging, excess flesh, draping them in wrinkled, poxriddled hides. This wretched appearance, in tandem with their great size and monstrous claws, leads most creatures to shun them. Indeed, even thawns find one another repulsive, creating a barely tolerable society of universal mistrust and loathing.\n\nThawns average 9 feet tall and their excess skin pushes their average weight to 700 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nOften called &#147;mud giants&#148; due to the foul, mottled skin that hangs loosely from their misshapen frames, thawns are universally malformed and dreadful, though each is quite distinctive in its singular monstrousness. Hair only grows in small tufts-thick, oily, and black. Their eyes easily pick up the flaws in their appearance, driving them to hide their figures as much as possible. Such revulsion of their form has led many scholars to hypothesize that thawns once possessed a different one, potentially relating them directly to ogres, hill giants, or other humanoids victimized by the hands of some more powerful and malicious race. Such possibilities remain nothing more than conjecture, however, as the brutes have no ability and even less interest in retaining details of their history. Even with this overpowering self-loathing, ancient instincts drive thawns together for safety and procreation, and no other race tolerates their ugliness and savagery.\n\nOpportunistic feeders, thawns seek out fresh battlefields and the scraps of slain beasts, reluctantly sharing their pickings with other parasites and scavengers. Alone as they wander the lands, thawns take care of their own needs first and foremost, caring little for others of their kind. Disdaining anything like a fair fight, they excel at crafting clever decoys and simple traps. Though sizable creatures, thawns typically strive to draw as little attention to themselves as possible, preferring to craft convincing dummies from mud, stone, and animal carcasses while they wait in hiding.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nMost thawns collect in nomadic groups, wandering grim plains and moody hills more like ravaging gangs than tribes traveling out of necessity. While their dim intellects provide them the most basic tools to seek out what they need to survive, their lives prove pitiful and often violently short. Hateful of themselves and their own kind, thawns aspire to no great works. Their nomadism thus comes less from need as from indifference, as one ugly hillside or leaking cave proves little better or worse than any other. It&apos;s their own inhabitance that causes most thawns to move on, as once they&apos;ve despoiled an area, it&apos;s then time to find new lands. This cycle of pillaging and pressing on proves uncomfortable to most thawns, but most lack the foresight to live any other way. Groups of thawns prove highly changeable, with members joining and leaving with little hesitation. As no love is lost between members, the savages drift apart as the whim takes them. Typically such changes in group structure go ignored, unless those left behind believe their former kinsman possesses some valuable information or reason for departing.\n\nThawns don&apos;t believe in hoarding material possessions, disdaining most metals and valuables in part because shiny surfaces invariably betray their monstrous visages to them. They use whatever is nearest at hand to satisfy their basic needs, though some carry with them items of simple usefulness or trophies of brutal victories. They move away from defended and civilized areas out of simple survival instinct, but attack small groups of humanoids if driven to desperation. Occasionally some uninformed samaritan attempts to take pity on a thawn, believing it cast out merely for its appearance and simplicity. Such charity typically proves fatal, though, as in the case of these hulks, their outward ugliness matches a dull-witted sadism and raving, violent hatred of all living things. Even ogres, with whom they hold many similarities, revile thawns as mindless killers and bogeymen, attacking and slaying them on sight.\n\nIf mud giants excel at any one thing, it&apos;s physical deception. Knowing most creatures&apos; hatred of them and their widespread treatment as dangerous lepers, they have learned to hide themselves where no sane creature would lurk and deceive eyes that would seek them with loathing. Thus, thawns willingly lair and hide amid filth-choked pools, muddy ravines, rotting bogs, and worse places. To aid them in their ambushes, they often create cunningly hidden pits, similar simple traps, and, most notoriously, decoys. With their misshapen frames, it&apos;s not difficult to mistake a tall, awkward pile of mud and rocks covered in rags for a thawn, while the reverse also proves dangerously true. More than one wary traveler, sighting a thawn-like shape upon a low hillock or on a dusty trail, has circled widely to avoid the dangerous hunter only to blunder into the ambush of the true thawn lurking in wait.\n\n{b}Treasure{/b}\nThawns rarely keep any possessions other than those which they can carry, these typically being crude or foul items even the most desperate wayfarers wouldn&apos;t consider clothing or food. In filthy sacks or-even more revoltingly-slung in useful flesh folds, there is a 40% chance that any thawn possesses 1d4 unsettling items, typically scraps of skin, leather, and stolen cloth for the creation of new cloaks; trophies of skulls, bones, and hide bound into crude fetishes; and rotting animal meat of unwholesome cuts and uncertain origin. Such things are typically soiled beyond use and rarely valuable, but often suggest what victims the mud giant has recently preyed upon and where their foul wanderings have led them." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruBshThyla" name="Marsupial, Brush Thylacine" description="Thylacines are large marsupial carnivores. They typically hunt alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Thylacines hunt at night, and rest during the day in nests hidden away from the world in hollowed trees or bushes. Farmers fear the creatures, blaming all manner of problems on them. However, thylacines are quite shy and antisocial, and usually avoid human settlements. Because of their odd, almost hybrid appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities.\n Ecology\nAt a distance, thylacines are sometimes mistaken for dogs or jackals, but can be easily identified by the defining stripes on their gold-hued backs. Thylacines usually have between 13 and 21 dark stripes. Their muscular jaws, filled with teeth, can gape open to an impressive 120 degrees.\n\nWhile thylacines may appear rather quick, they are far from proficient runners. Due to their oddly shaped legs, their run is awkward and slow. However, the animals can stand on their haunches for short periods, helping them to fend off other predators and kill larger prey. Thylacines are also capable jumpers, not dissimilar to kangaroos, and often surprise opponents with this ability.\n\nBy most standards, a thylacine&apos;s senses aren&apos;t impressive. They can see and hear well enough to hunt prey, but their olfactory senses, while competent, do not approach canine levels. Thylacines hunt in a manner similar to wolves, focusing on wearing down prey by chasing and harrying instead of direct attacks. Their stomachs are able to greatly distend, enabling thylacines to eat vast amounts of food in a single sitting, devouring larger animals to compensate for long periods of drought or poor hunting.\n\nThylacines are quite cowardly, avoiding confrontation whenever possible. If cornered, a thylacine tries to frighten off attackers with growls, hisses, and threat-yawns, in which it displays its teeth and the full extent of its wide jaws. If these threat displays are ineffective, however, a thylacine does not hesitate to attack. Their powerful jaws may not snap bones, but they can still make quick work of an unprepared traveler. In addition, thylacines are not picky eaters. If driven to starvation, they aren&apos;t afraid to hunt humans, in which case their nocturnal hunting cycles tend to lead them to attack sleeping travelers or outlying farms.\n\nThylacines are fiercely independent. While wolves and other canines can be tamed and domesticated, thylacines are wild without exception. If captured, they become territorial and mark everything they can in their territories with strong-smelling odors from their scent glands. Many a farmer has made the sad mistake of attempting to domesticate a thylacine, only to find his farm smelling atrocious and his livestock killed in the night.\n\nAn adult thylacine stands 2 feet tall at the shoulder, is 4 feet long (not counting an additional 2 feet of tail), and weighs roughly 50 pounds. The larger and more aggressive brush thylacine breed can reach almost 8 feet long from nose to tail-tip, though still only weighing 100 pounds.\n Habitat &amp; Society\nThylacines breed year-round, but like most marsupials, they don&apos;t maintain strong family ties. Females keep their young in pouches. Unlike many marsupials, males also have pouches, but these are to protect their genitals, not their young. Females produce about 10 viable joeys in a given breeding season, but only about four can expect to see more than a year of life. The average thylacine lives between 4 and 10 years.\n\nThylacines keep dens similar to those of plains mammals such as foxes and cougars. Dens are often very hard to find, in trees, caves, or other inconvenient locations out of the way of most predators, and in natural shade. Thylacine young reside in the den for only a short period, as joeys stay in their mothers&apos; pouches for most of their development. During periods when a mother is incubating her young, she can be downright violent to trespassers or any other potential threats.\n\n{b}Regional Variants{/b}\nSeveral breeds of thylacine are known to exist, hunting plains and woodlands in regions of Avistan, Garund, and beyond. Three of the most common are noted here.\n\n{i}Blood Cougar:{/i} Not actually related to the big cats, Tian thylacines are known as blood cougars for their vivid red coloring. Surprisingly, they are often kept as pets by Tian-La leaders, as blood cougars are more easily domesticated and tamed, and serve as far better companions and hunting aids. Although they are slightly smaller than normal thylacines, they make up for it in ferocity and cunning. These red beasts have the advanced creature template.\n\n{i}Casmar Thylacine:{/i} In Casmaron, most thylacines are smaller than the typical beast. For this reason, they tend to form larger packs, often twice the size of an average thylacine pack. These smaller beasts stand 6 inches to a foot shorter at the shoulders. Casmar thylacines are normal thylacines with the young creature template added, and gather in packs of 2-10.\n\n{i}Sarusan Wolf:{/i} The Sarusan wolf is a slightly bigger and more doglike form of the normal thylacine. Whereas indigenous people refer to the thylacine as a lion or other great cat, the Sarusan wolf has an unmistakable canine jaw. While they are physically larger, Sarusan wolves are actually less hardy than their traditional cousins, due to poor weight allocation. Prone to tiring quickly and falling down, Sarusan wolves focus more on rapid takedowns of their prey. Sarusan wolves have a Constitution score of 12 and gain Power Attack as a bonus feat." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruGrimStag" name="Grim White Stag" description="The Grim White Stag is rarely seen in the flesh more than once in a generation, and only when a settlement faithful to Erastil is in mortal danger. All good creatures of the forest recognize his might and near-divinity and fall in behind him when they hear his bugling call to war-such as when he attacked the spawn of Rovagug known as the Gray-Stag-Devourer to draw it away from settled areas. Other than his mighty summons, he does not speak to humanoids, though he understand several languages of mortals, fey, and heavenborn.\n\nThe Stag is not an envoy of peace and cares little for festivities. When he is on Golarion, he is focused on his task, whether defending a village, creating a firebreak in a forest, or transporting refugees to safety. His power is in action, not thought or debate, and he prefers to move in, finish what must be done, and move on; when dealing with mortals who want to over-plan or over-think what to do next, he is likely to take action just to prompt them into moving forward. He can be almost suicidal in his dedication, willing to throw away his life to buy his allies more time to rescue others or bolster defenses.\n\nThough Erastil rarely sends him to the mortal world in physical form, sometimes he appears as a shimmering, spectral vision, particularly on foggy mornings or at twilight, usually to lead a lost child home or warn one of Erastil&apos;s followers away from some threat. However, the church&apos;s limited records do not differentiate these appearances from simple visions sent by the god (especially as they don&apos;t have the resources to magically investigate these occurrences and determine which type they are), so it is unclear how active a role the Stag has on Golarion.\n\nThe Stag was once just a powerful spirit creature, worshiped by early humans under the tutelage of druids of the Green Faith. When Erastil&apos;s religion became more prominent, the Stag allied with Old Deadeye, respecting the godling&apos;s wisdom, strength, and nobility. Some regional tales of the Grim White Stag say that in the early days of the world, Erastil hunted the beast, seeking to subdue its wildness and make a bow of its horns, yet the Stag proved so agile and hardy that after weeks of pursuit, the god of the hunt tired of tracking the beast. At night, as the god stopped to rest and enjoy a simple meal, the Stag fearlessly approached, bowing low to the tenacious tracker. Erastil, understanding that the beast was no savage, welcomed the Stag into his camp and shared his meal with the ancient spirit of the forest. From then on, the two have understood and respected one another, sharing the same reverence for the forests and creatures there, as well as care for all who would live honestly and in peace with the denizens of the wilderness. Some even go on to say that the Grim White Stag shed his horns to furnish Erastil with his great antlered bow, but belief in such tales varies regionally.\n\nDistant kin to other great animal spirits of the ancient times-including Thron, the Prince That Howls-he is greatly respected by intelligent animals and followers of the old ways. He sometimes performs tasks for Gozreh, but the nature god&apos;s amorality often offends the Stag.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nThe Grim White Stag doesn&apos;t need to eat but enjoys a few bites of the rich grass, wild berries, hay, corn cobs, and other vegetable matter often fed to domesticated herds. He normally only eats to be polite or (though more so in the ancient days than now) to show he accepts an offering made by worshipers. He recognizes that his strength can easily harm others, including plant life; he is cautious when moving through forests so as to not crush trees with the force of his passage and uses his powers to heal any harm he causes. Most natural forest creatures possess an instinctual understanding of the Grim White Stag and move aside as it passes, typically meaning that only unwary monsters, oblivious hunters, and others with no right to be in the forest fall as accidental victims to the herald&apos;s passage.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nStories tell that long ago the Stag would travel in spirit form and sometimes possess the bodies of druids or shamans, speaking to the faithful or calling for the conservation of herds that were being over-hunted, but this was always temporary. There is little evidence that any of his divine power lingered in these primitive priests, though some cave paintings show more than one deerheaded man leading a tribe in a hunt, possibly indicating some sort of unusual magic or sorcerer bloodline based on the Stag&apos;s essence. When not in the mortal world, the Stag roams the area near Erastil&apos;s domain in Heaven, watching over the god&apos;s servants in the afterlife. In the rare times when he is in a whimsical mood, he has been known to let Erastil or other good gods and spirits chase him, testing them to see if they can manage to lay but a single hand upon him." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ruRorkoun" name="Rorkoun" description="Little-known denizens of the Darklands, rorkouns prey upon the unwary from lairs amid the deepest pools and waterways. Known as &#147;wretch worms&#148; and &#147;eyes of Orv,&#148; these disgusting abominations writhe through flooded pits and crevices, feeding upon nearly all they encounter and occasionally breaking forth from the depths into the world of light to glut themselves upon the plump, tender creatures found there.\n\nRorkouns measure over 25 feet in length, and beneath the strange secretions that provide them with a false, apparent bulk, the creatures possess a ribbon-thin body only a foot wide. A typical rorkoun weighs a mere 200 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nLittle is known of the anatomy and life processes of rorkouns because of both their rarity and their fundamental dependency on water. As soon as a rorkoun leaves the water-which none ever do willingly, even to pursue the most tempting prey-it begins dehydrating at a deadly rate. Most that are ripped from their native pools wither to long strips of jerky-like flesh in a few short minutes. Thus, much of what is known of the beasts comes from direct observation, a methodology that proves dangerous for most researchers.\n\nRorkouns possess lengthy bodies similar to tapeworms, with simple, decentralized bodily systems. Their flat, oblong heads branch into four split mouthparts set on throat-like stalks. At the top of the head, a single, bulging eye scans the creature&apos;s surroundings with uncanny sensitivity. Their heads are the thickest parts of their bodies, which taper gradually to a powerful tail. The strangest quality of these creatures is that their body exudes a rubbery, gluelike substance that swiftly hardens into a flexible, puttylike mass. Rorkouns use these secretions to better protect their bodies, seal off their chosen lairs (to prevent water from seeping out), and capture their prey.\n\nSeveral explorers who have encountered rorkouns have spread unnerving stories regarding the beasts, suggesting that rorkouns are not individual creatures but rather the impossibly long appendages of some unknown aberrant body. Their hesitance to leave the water is thus claimed to be because they are incapable of separating themselves from their greater body; the frantic thrashing of rorkoun that are forcibly removed from the water as they struggle to return is compared to the final desperate twitches of an amputated limb. What terrible body might support limbs as vile as rorkouns few dare to conjecture, but whatever hidden beings (or more terrible still, single being) manipulate these horrors from the darkness must be unlike anything known to the denizens of Golarion&apos;s surface-and must hunger endlessly.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSolitary creatures, rorkoun rarely share hunting grounds. Most, upon encountering another of their kind, attempt to leave the vicinity, avoiding any sort of confrontation and often ridding the area of both creatures. This aversion proves baffling, especially considering the extreme rarity of the beasts, though some suggest that the abominations might prove more receptive toward others of their kind when far below the surface.\n\nThose scholars who study rorkouns claim the strange beasts understand both the Common language and that of goblins, though most believe the creatures also have a silent language used among their own kind-despite the creatures&apos; tendency to avoid contact with one another. They frequently live near goblin and mite communities. While these species share an ecological niche as scavengers and occasional hunters, the connection is a bit more complex. Rorkouns never hunt goblins or mites as they find the taste of their flesh repulsive. The creatures do, however, find the savory flavor of greater humanoids succulent; they appreciate the zeal with which those races seek to exterminate goblinkind, as it brings prey close to their lairs for them to feast on. Cowardly and secretive, rorkouns lurk in murky pools or bogs near such creatures&apos; camps, hoping to provoke a fight. Once the battle begins, rorkouns strike, picking off the weakest creatures in the fray before slinking off to digest the meal in the privacy of their dens or some other location where their prey&apos;s allies might find it difficult to follow. A rorkoun&apos;s benefactors rarely understand the reason for this strange kind of cooperation. While mites tend to fear and flee the aberrations-just as they do most creatures- goblins often concoct more elaborate reasons for why these alien horrors might aid them. Typically, a particularly imaginative goblin convinces his tribe that the rorkoun is in fact a god and that they are its chosen people. All too often this inspires the community to new heights of crazed zealotry and the invention of bizarre forms of sacrifice and adoration.\n\nOccasionally rorkouns find their way into the dilapidated or abandoned sewer systems of ruined or declining cities where the shattered remains of such networks have collapsed and formed connections to the Darklands. There rorkouns crawl and swim their way through the slick tunnels and drainpipes, feeding on refuse, vermin, and the occasional sewer dweller or rat catcher. Such unusual beasts rarely prove significant threats, emerging to menace the surface only through what abandoned tunnels and drainage ditches they might happen upon." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruBlodeuwe" name="Blodeuwedd" description="The mysterious blodeuwedds stand apart from dryads, their tree-bound sisters of the forest, instead watching over the open plains and prairies. They frequently guard the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various gateways and entry points into the First World-a task they take very seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such regions behind veils of illusion and trickery, quietly observing anyone passing through their lands, and occasionally sending mysterious messages to warn them away or to summon allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over a point of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural beauty, transforming such fields-usually only a few acres in size-into sites of unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical blodeuwedd stands a little over 5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nInstead of developing a lifelong bond with trees, blodeuwedds hold an affinity for open grasslands, moors, and plains. They survive off the land, taking nourishment from all that nature provides, while also looking after prairie animals in times of drought or lean winters. Unlike dryads, blodeuwedds have no dependency on the plants around them; they can willingly leave their chosen moor to visit their fey kin, scout their domain in owl form, or even mingle with frontier communities, changing shape to appear elven or human.\n\nEvery 15 or so years, blodeuwedds may reproduce through a natural ritual of fertility known as the Blooming, a process by which they commune with the adopted plants of their surrounding field. At the height of the spring season, they then exchange pollen with every flower within 300 yards, a complicated and sensuous act that eventually allows a blodeuwedd to conceive. It takes 6 months to carry a new blodeuwedd to term, and they frequently come together to act as midwives during this time to ensure successful deliveries for one another. Some tales tell of blodeuwedds displaced from their homes or in captivity capable of performing the Blooming by drawing off the lifeforce of amorous men, ending in the withering death of the would-be father.

These elaborate structures resemble small rises and hillocks that overlook ley lines and fairy paths between sites of great power and importance to the fey, which the blodeuwedds jealously guard from nonfey creatures. Most fey recognize such service by referring to blodeuwedds with honorific titles meant to curry their favor. As a result, many blodeuwedds set themselves up as queens or wardens to receive tribute from favored kin who pass through their realms.\n\nBlodeuwedds also rely on plant growth and their ability to speak with plants to manage the surrounding fields, encouraging them to grow into complex mazes of hedgerows, tangles, and thickets to better shape their territory.

They frequently guard the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various gateways and entry points into the First World-a task they take very seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such regions behind veils of illusion and trickery, quietly observing anyone passing through their lands, and occasionally sending mysterious messages to warn them away or to summon allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over a point of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural beauty, transforming such fields-usually only a few acres in size-into sites of unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical blodeuwedd stands a little over 5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years.\n\nParticularly old and active blodeuwedds-typically the eldest within a region that more than 10 blodeuwedds inhabit-sometimes ascend to the status of queens, gaining additional power and prestige among their own kind. They develop a greater affinity for the lands they rule and attract even more followers. The following adjustments to a standard blodeuwedd represent a young blodeuwedd queen at CR 8. More powerful varieties typically add class levels in druid or sorcerer, both of which are considered favored classes for a blodeuwedd queens.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nInstead of developing a lifelong bond with trees, blodeuwedds hold an affinity for open grasslands, moors, and plains. They survive off the land, taking nourishment from all that nature provides, while also looking after prairie animals in times of drought or lean winters.

  <thing id="ruClawbat" name="Clawbat" description="Clawbats, or einchadu, as they&apos;re known to the tribes of greater Iobaria, haunt the desolate expanses of northeastern Avistan and the rugged lands beyond. Swarming forth from their shadowy dens to hunt by night, these strange predators thirst for blood, scavenging from the victims of greater nocturnal hunters and stalking those foolish enough not to fear dangers in the dark. Drawn by the scent of spilled blood, clawbats fearlessly follow deadly beasts, and more than one traveler has narrowly escaped a predator&apos;s nearly lethal ambush only to find his luck change as a swarm of wings and eyes descend upon him.\n\nThe span of an average clawbat&apos;s dual pairs of wings stretches 3 feet wide, lifting aloft rubbery bodies weighing 2 to 4 pounds. Tales of more monstrous clawbats, with wings that blot out the stars as they swoop away with children and small animals, also pass through the civilized lands of Iobaria. Such overgrown clawbats might be constructed by making use of the giant creature simple template.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nClawbats are scavengers and opportunistic hunters. They rarely attack creatures larger than rodents or birds unless the creatures-or those traveling with them-have been weakened by a stronger attacker. Even the presence of such a hunter is not enough to deter an ever-hungry clawbat, which is drawn to attack bloodied creatures in the thick of battle.\n\nClawbats are poor fighters; they prefer to fly past victims, strike quickly to draw blood, and then make pass after pass, aggravating their victims&apos; existing wounds with their ribbon-like tongues. This tactic rarely wins the scavengers more than a drop or two of nourishment per attack, driving them to harass a victim until it drops. When the wounds of clawbats&apos; prey prove too insignificant to fell it, clawbats attack more directly, circling to peel away strip after strip of flesh in wet grabs of their tentacular maws. After their prey has fallen to the pain of a dozen such wounds, clawbats land and vigorously lap up their meal until their bellies are bloated with gore.\n\nAiding clawbats in their hunts is their acrid saliva, a stinging milky-white fluid that possesses an anticoagulant quality, causing their bites to leave messy wounds that bleed until treated. This effect allows clawbats to surprise attack most Small creatures and wait safely out of reach until the prey collapses. Healthy larger prey can typically withstand the assault of a lone clawbat, but a whole clutch of the creatures might easily throw even a sturdy beast into panicked, bleeding terror. The freedom with which clawbat wounds bleed also serves to attract other clawbats in the vicinity, and a few scratches might potentially bring an entire clutch down upon even a slightly wounded creature.\n\nClawbat eyes are exceedingly abnormal, being nearly flat, yet still functional. As the creatures&apos; eyes are set upon their wings, the constant flapping gives the clawbats a constantly shifting view of the area around them, but particularly the land below-an experience which would seem terribly jarring to any creature not used to the experience. The eyes are one-sided, occupying only the inner part of their thick, fleshy wings, and are lidless, being constantly watered by ducts surrounding each eye. The profuse watering of these organs causes clawbats to fling a fine spray as they move, which often serves as a victim&apos;s first warning of impending danger.\n\nOther flying creatures, such as hawks, eagles, and owls, make up the clawbats&apos; natural predators. The sounds of these raptors can dissuade clawbats from attacking, even in the midst of a feeding frenzy, and will send them winging straight for their roost to avoid attack. Giant centipedes occasionally invade clawbat lairs, crawling up the wall or waiting for their prey at the exit. Clawbats have little natural defense against creatures with thick exoskeletons and avoid them when it is possible to attack an easier source of food.\n\nClawbats can live up to 20 years, though most die earlier due to predation, accidents, or infighting.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nClawbats are found far from heavily civilized lands, though whether this is due to civilized efforts to stamp them out or because they prefer distant, half-wild places is open to debate. They live in clutches of up to 15 members, favoring dark places that offer easy aerial access to the outside world. Each of these places must have a roost that allows the creatures to drop the 15 feet necessary to begin flying; if a stationary clawbat attempts to start flying without sufficient drop, it glides to the ground and must mount to a higher point before it can launch again. This makes them skittish in claustrophobic spaces, for they do not like to be at a disadvantage, and this in turn leads them to infest places such as ruined structures, large, open caves, and fissures.\n\nNew clutches of clawbats contain 4 to 6 young members, which depart a clutch once it has grown to exceed 15 members. The young fly 10 to 15 miles away, searching for a suitable structure or crag to shield them during the day. Once a group of clawbats leaves its original home, the members feel no loyalty to their former family and compete fiercely for resources.\n\nOn numerous occasions, mages, druids, and barbarians shamans have attempted to capture and train clawbats. While the creatures&apos; awkwardness once they are brought to ground makes them relatively easy to capture-though frustratingly difficult to restrain given their flexibility and many squirming limbs-no documented attempt to train the beasts has ever succeeded. Even efforts paired with steady diets of blood typically end in the clawbat attacking its keeper just as often as availing themselves of the easier food source. This, and their regular attempts to feed even when critically wounded, have won the creatures a reputation for being dumbly vicious, a reputation that leads most thinking creatures to curse and move quickly to exterminate any clawbats that appear in their lands." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruPeluda" name="Peluda" description="Wild dragon-kin that stalk the savage places of the world, peludas loathe all the weak, fragile creatures smaller than themselves, especially the various arrogant breeds of humanoids. Viewing themselves as true and regal dragons, these brutes seek to dominate swampy or overgrown territories but a few miles wide, driving off other creatures and despoiling the land as they please. Often their lands become littered with traces of their passage: great footprints in muddy banks, felled trees, and rotted corpses riddled with peludas&apos; lance-like quills. Although most think themselves clever, peludas swiftly grow tired of tactics and debate, and it often takes little more than the suggestion of a trespasser to make them run amuck.\n\nElder peludas often appear far bulkier than their bare physical frames would suggest. As the majority of their roughly serpentine bodies bristle with lengthy quills, they look to be far stouter than they truly are with their naked reptilian necks, tails, and feet sprouting from a forest of deadly barbs. A typical 15-foot-long adult peluda can raise its head up to 8 feet off the ground and weighs approximately 300 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nPeludas have a voracious appetite, gorging themselves on all manner of beasts drawn to the rivers, marshlands, and wild plains where they live. Much like a snake, these creatures can unhinge their lower jaw to swallow larger prey after pulverizing it with blows from their massive tail. They prefer to do so, however, after roasting their meal with their fiery breath. Peludas fear nothing smaller than themselves and routinely bring down larger prey even at a short distance with volleys of their poisonous quills. Their dangerous hide also acts as a defense to ward off gigantic predators like rocs or even true dragons, making peludas an unappetizing-and poisonous-meal at best.\n\nAlthough most peludas prefer the cool darkness of reedy marshlands-especially sparsely forested bogs, as their quills can make navigating dense overgrowth frustrating-peludas occasionally venture further inland to enhance their diets, feeding on the livestock, crops, and people of rural communities. They see these excursions as nothing more than brief hunting sorties, often with the opportunity to cruelly ruin the fragile works of lesser creatures.\n\nPeludas lay small clutches of eggs that never result in more than two or three young at a time. Ensuring that such limited numbers of offspring reach maturity presents a significant challenge for these violent creatures, as just as many of these young, bald peludas fall to the tempers of their parents as to attacks from interlopers or other beasts.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nPeludas often lair in caves, either caverns half-submerged in bogs or cool rents in the earth. While not exceptionally intelligent compared to other dragons, peludas possess a heightened survival instinct and a penchant for collecting interesting shards of metal from tools, armor, and weapons taken from their victims. They also swallow shiny coins, gems, and jewelry, believing it helps strengthen their quills and the potency of their fiery breath.\n\nOccasionally a particularly cunning tribe of savage humanoids-typically lizardfolk or orcs-finds a way to assuage the temper of a peluda that lairs nearby, elevating the creature to the status of a local liege or deity. Whether the tribe believes in the dragon-kin&apos;s lordly status varies from community to community, though all pay the more powerful creature deference and many provide offerings of captives and wealth. Although peludas rarely have any actual affection for such servants-and more than one tribe has been scoured from the land in a random fit of flaming temper-all revel in the submission of weaker creatures and the gifts of gold and food they bring, as such deeds act as a balm to their typically fragile draconic egos. As nearly all peluda dwell on the fact that they lack the fearsomeness and power of true dragons, they do all they can to exhibit their ferocity and might. While the destruction they cause and the subservience of weaker creatures indulges peludas&apos; fragile delusions, any suggestion that they are not every bit as mighty as their draconic peers-especially from those they view as lesser creatures-throws them into a rage few provokers can hope to survive." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruStygira" name="Stygira" description="Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras*mdash;or stone witches, as they are often called-command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches.\n\nStygiras on average stand 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nIt is said that the stygiras draw their power from stone and from the darkness. Certainly they live their entire lives in the dark, traveling through intricate, maze-like caverns and the moonless sky with equal ease. They draw their sustenance from the base things they scrape from the earth-vermin, molds, lichens, and whatever fleshy things happen into their lairs. Although technically blind, stygiras have almost supernaturally keen hearing, taste, and touch, and so have no need for sight. What remains of the eyes that lurk as vestigial elements of their anatomy hide beneath the scarred flesh of their faces. While such remnant organs typically go unused, they can still detect the presence of light, an uncomfortable sensation that all stygiras take great pains to avoid. Stygiras can in fact travel under the skies, but they quickly become agoraphobic and retreat to the safety of shadowy canyons or caves as soon as possible. They avoid the sunlight hours, with most willing to face death in the darkness rather than take their chances venturing into the light.\n\nAll stygiras are female; they are capable of reproducing with humanoids of nearly any species and always bearing three or more withered-and typically stillborn-stygira young. Yet stygiras make up for their appallingly low live birth and survival rates with unnaturally long lifespans. None can say how long stygiras who don&apos;t meet their end by violence might live, but instances of stone witches living for 3 or more centuries are well documented.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nStygiras most commonly occupy lands near the phenomenally ancient tombs and monuments of the cyclops empires. While some of the crazed witches make the impossible claim that all stygira are the surviving mortal apprentices of primordial cyclops seers, saner minds posit that the predecessors of these crones were primitive human shamans and mystics who managed to tap into a degree of the fallen empires&apos; powers. Whatever the case, the connection between stygiras and the ancient cyclopes lingers in their shared language and the mad scrawls covering many of these hags&apos; lairs.\n\n{b}Stygira Gems{/b}\nThe cultic lore passed down from stygira to stygira tells of the existence of rare gems of might that grant special powers to the stone witch who bears them. In rare cases, stygiras have been encountered clutching ancient and frighteningly sculpted stones exhibiting weird powers; in even more extraordinary cases, they have borne a veritable arsenal of crystals. While all gemstones of significant size allow a stygira to make use of her gem eye and gem gaze abilities, a few rare gems alter the crones&apos; gaze abilities. These added abilities do not increase a stygira&apos;s CR.\n\nThe adjacent list of stones and abilities merely represent those few stones whose use has been documented after encounters with stygiras, and it is likely not all-inclusive. These effects function only for stygiras. Except where noted, new effects replace an ability&apos;s typical effect. Treat a stygira as an 8th-level caster for effects granting spell-like abilities. Also listed are the common values of crude, eyesized gems of the following types. \n\n\nBeryl; 25 gp; Gem gaze causes the sickened condition.\nDiamond; 1,500 gp; Gem gaze causes a charm monster effect that lasts for 1 hour.\nJade; 50 gp; Cast poison as a spell-like ability 3/day.\nOpal; 25 gp; Cast stone shape as a spell-like ability 3/day.\nPainite; 1,750 gp; Erupts in a 8d6 fireball dealing acid damage if thrown." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruBogStrid" name="Bog Strider" description="Bog striders call themselves Ses&apos;h in Aquan, but the first explorers to encounter them named the reclusive bug-men after their ability to stride on water like solid ground. Individual bog striders resemble upright beetles with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. They depend on their waterborne speed to quickly chase down prey and flee from predators. Otherwise, they care little for civilizations other than their own, rarely venturing from the swampy rivers and lakes they call home.\n\nThe long, spindly legs of bog striders give the impression of a greater size then their relatively fragile frames actually account for. Although their limbs are in most cases more than double, even triple, the length of other humanoids, their inflexible joints grant them little more mobility, range of motion, and capability to reach than others. Regardless of gender, nearly all bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nBog striders reproduce during specific seasonal and astrological cycles that occur only two to three times during their entire lifespan-detecting their moment of peak fertility through changes in the weather and tidal effects upon large bodies of water. Thereafter, pregnant females lay a clutch of four to 10 eggs, keeping them submerged and guarding against predators until they hatch 6 months later. The younglings then cling to their mother for the next 3 months as they learn the rudiments of survival and socialization within the tribe.\n\nUnfortunately, predators (intelligent or otherwise) often view bog strider eggs and younglings as easy prey. Hatcheries suffer attacks by crocodiles and giant frogs, while birds of prey, boggards, and human hunters pick off younglings who stray from their mothers on the open water. As a result of these reproductive challenges, bog striders struggle to keep pace with other swamp-dwelling cultures, suffering through periods of decline and nearextinction. These difficulties make them increasingly insular and territorial, meeting interlopers with spears more often than diplomacy.\n\nA bog strider&apos;s diet consists almost entirely of meat. They routinely hunt for fish, crustaceans, or snakes, and occasionally hunt for birds, giant wasps, or dragonflies. They particularly excel at spearfishing and snaring airborne prey with thrown nets.\n\nThe wide stance of a bog strider&apos;s four legs displaces its weight over any body of water by maintaining the surface tension with a cushion of air trapped beneath several small ridges on each foot. While not dissimilar to the motion of minute water-striding insects, for bog striders the motion is aided by some manner of innate magic or other supernatural relationship with the water. Regardless of the source of this ability, it allows them to literally walk on water, though they can also fully submerge and hide below the surface if they desire.\n\nBog striders who survive into adulthood can live up to 60 years. Each youngling develops a varied pattern of mottled gray and brown coloration across its carapace, uniquely distinguishing it from others. These spots tend to fade as bog striders age, causing their elders to all look much alike.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nBog striders can survive in all but the coldest of climes, living their entire lives on the rivers, lakes, and bogs where they make their homes. Their society focuses primarily on survival due to the depredations of natural predators and wars with lizardfolk and boggards. Each member of a bog strider tribe, both male and female, learns to defend the tribe at the earliest possible age. In addition, everyone must develop a skill that contributes to the community&apos;s prosperity, and by extension, the continued survival of their species.\n\nFemales serve as the builders of bog strider society. They weave large mats of reeds, rushes, and netting that they coat in waterproof tree sap to trap pockets of air below the water&apos;s surface where they can safely build and hide their villages. When not looking after their young, the females continuously expand or replace flooded sections of these communities. Meanwhile, male bog striders act as hunters and gatherers, bringing back enough food to last through harsh winters and times of drought. They also scout the waterways for threats to their community, leaving those who pass through their territory unmolested but fighting off those who attempt to stay or exploit the same resources they depend upon. Frequently small bands also venture far from their native lands, seeking to find new, uninhabited waterways where their imperiled communities might be left in peace.\n\nSeer-queens rule over multiple bog strider communities to form secluded tribal unions, acting as religious leaders and reading the river currents or tides to divine the will of Gozreh. Many become clerics or druids worshiping the nature god in its feminine form, though they interpret Gozreh more as a great body of water than a likeness of themselves. Because seer-queens lose their personal markings like any other elder, they are difficult to distinguish from the rest of their community. They often use this advantage to hide among their own people, both to thwart those who would target them and to mingle more freely among their subjects." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruCalathga" name="Calathgar" description="Known to grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from the snow-cloaked trees, calathgars, or &#147;hail lilies,&#148; grow to a size and possess an alien beauty that make their cuttings greatly desired in civilized lands. Yet, what few beside the wariest hunters and most knowledgeable denizens of the forests realize is that hail lilies are more than mere flowers-their fully grown varieties possess not only a deadly way of spreading their frozen seeds but also an even more dangerous trait: thought. Known among their own kind as calathgars, these ice-tinged plants move slowly and possess little in the way of society, yet they perceive their surroundings, know when their frigid gardens are threatened, feel pain, and-most tenaciously-seek a chilling revenge when their young are despoiled.\n\nThe blooms of a fully grown calathgar measures 3 feet in diameter, though some have reported flowers up to 5, 8, and even 10 feet wide. Able to crawl on three tendrillike roots, one of these plants might stand as high as 4 feet off the ground, and when heavy with seeds might weigh as much as 50 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nCalathgars are immediately identifiable, even from a distance, by their sky-blue petals, a color repeated by few other forms of plant life in such size or brilliance. Yet typically, these blooms only unfurl during the brightest hours of the day or when the plants feel threatened. At all other times, calathgars keep their flowers closed, defending the sensitive structures within and presenting large, blue-gray sepals to the outside world. Calathgar young look little different from tall blue flowers-hence many horticulturists identify them merely as hail lilies. It takes nearly a year for a juvenile calathgar to display any kind of concerted movement, aside from the opening and closing of their petals and a few markedly un-plant-like twitches. Their sense of scent and ability to communicate function as soon as their buds first grow-typically within 2 weeks of sprouting from the cold earth.\n\nTwo rings of sensory organs help calathgars remain aware of their surroundings: a cluster of lobes at the base of the flower and another situated around the stamen within. Both are capable of not just deciphering light in an approximation of visual sight, but also receiving information via a highly developed kind of scent. This sense of smell is much more developed in the plants than their ability to see-though at close ranges their sight can prove just as accurate as most humanoids. To this end, most communication between the plants is scent-based, utterly silent, and often imperceptible to non-plant creatures. At times when the plants feel threatened, however, they exude a smell like vinegar or, if angry, a coppery odor.\n\nFor all their developments as a species, calathgars possess a strange connection, even symbiosis, with a far less complex type of growth: brown mold. Notorious for its ability to drain the warmth from an area and freeze the unwary, brown mold not only benefits calathgars-allowing them to grow comfortably in areas they might otherwise find inhospitably warm-but it also pervades the roots and internal structures of the plants. Some suggest that calathgars might be some advanced form of brown mold, yet the idea is typically dismissed, as such mutually beneficial relationships are well documented in the world of mundane flora. As a calathgar grows to maturity, brown mold thrives within its flower and internal structures, aiding in keeping the growth cool and providing it with frigid defensive abilities and a way to spread its seeds-freezing and clinging to creatures that come near before dropping off later. The flowers provide the mold ample places to grow, and defense from creatures that might threaten it. The adult plants also prove so riddled with nutrients upon which the fungus flourishes that should a calathgar violently die amid brown mold, the fungal patch instantly explodes with growth-typically to the detriment of whatever ended the calathgar&apos;s life.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nCalathgars have little in the way of society, other than grouping together for mutual defense. Despite their intellects, the plants&apos; psyches prove distinctive and alien in comparison to those of animals and sentient creatures. They have little interest in emotions, culture, or ambition, yet they possess nearly flawless memories and an understanding of experiences which they can share with other calathgars by scent as easily as (and far more effectively than) humanoids can pass on information by speech. Yet where calathgars do seem most like humanoids is in their capacity to care for their young and seek reprisal should any harm befall them. Should an immature calathgar be trampled, plucked, or otherwise ruined, adults do all they can to pursue and deal vengeance upon those who murdered their young, planting a new generation in the killer&apos;s frozen flesh. While calathgars can be reasoned with and most prove generally accepting of honest apologies from those capable of communicating with them, like most enraged parents, an incensed calathgar is rarely in a mood to speak." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruFirstBla" name="First Blade" description="Said to have been formed from an unthinking sliver of steel dashed from Gorum&apos;s blade during one of his first clashes with a long-felled god-beast of the Outer Sphere, the First Blade is a living tool of war. Inspired by Gorum&apos;s divine bloodlust, this shard of the god of battle&apos;s blade continues to obey and do battle in the service of its divine master. Having been reforged through the eons into a manifestation of Gorum&apos;s perfect warrior, the First Blade serves as the war god&apos;s herald, traveling where its master desires. Yet while the heralds of most deities go forth to bear the word of their divine patrons or answer the most desperate summons of their gods&apos; most pious servants, the First Blade endlessly marches to battle. Never interested in diplomacy or subtlety, Gorum has little need for a messenger other than one capable of communicating in the language of the battlefield. The god of battle answers the calls only of those who please him in battle and request his heralds&apos; aid in epic clashes dedicated to his honor-weakling priests seeking salvation or cowardly revenge never have their entreaties for the herald&apos;s presence answered.\n\nThe appearance of the First Blade changes to match a style of armor impressive to those against whom it will be doing battle, though typically notched as if it has been employed in numerous battles. Rarely seen in the same form twice, its plate mail form might vary from the elegant mail of angelic hosts to slabs of spiked iron over thick bestial hides more common to orc warlords. Whatever the shape, the interior of the armor is never visible. Those who have come close enough to the First Blade and survived claim that only more layers of armor lie beneath its plates, though the hint of something glowing within sometimes spills forth should the herald suffer a rare but occasional wound. Regardless of the specifics of its warlike form, the herald of Gorum typically stands about 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 2 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAlthough a living creature, the First Blade is little more than a weapon of Gorum, knowing little beyond its lord&apos;s command and going only where he wills. Like a golem in many respects, the herald leaves but scant traces upon the lands it passes through between battles, eating little and having no need even to breathe. In war, however, its presence and passage are obvious, marked by rent bodies and blood-soaked earth.\n\nAlthough the First Blade can speak a variety of languages, few of those encountering the herald have heard it do so. Like its master, the First Blade prefers actions-especially violent, purposeful ones-to words. Typically its words are brief refutations of those who have summoned it for an unfit purpose, though several legends tell of the divine messenger offering its respect or the pleasure of its master before striking the final blow upon an opponent who has put up a particularly capable fight or proven her prowess on the field of battle.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nWhile the herald of Gorum answers the call of servants of the lord of battle who seek their lord&apos;s intervention in appropriately glorious battle, no accounts exist of the First Blade responding to any summons involving a task other than combat. Most accounts of the herald tell of the gory swaths it cuts through battlefields of heroes, in clashes between titanic armies, or in weeks-long battles between history&apos;s greatest warlords. Rumors among Gorum&apos;s clergy also suggest that sometimes the herald appears when summoned to a lesser battle, but upon finding a mere skirmish or clash among weaklings, it slaughters all involved. Whether such an end is an honor or a disgrace for those killed remains a subject of some debate among theologians." compset="Race" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="ruIrlgaunt" name="Irlgaunt" description="Irlgaunts are large, spider-like aberrations that lurk in mountainous regions and vertical subterranean chasms. While large and imposing, these arachnid-like beings are deceivingly agile, their reflexes fast and movements swift, similar to the darting motions of a hunting insect. Irlgaunts are as quick-witted as they are nimble and have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics. In Iobaria, the beasts are recognized for their eerily patient predations, hiding amid jagged rocks to attack prey and ejecting crippling blasts of rock and digestive acids upon their victims. Irlgaunts typically attack travelers scaling mountain paths with steep cliff sides, using the hazardous terrain to knock unstable hikers to their death, then skittering down the sheer cliff faces to lap up the fleshy pulp below.\n\nMost irlgaunts stand between 11 and 13 feet tall and weigh around 3,000 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nIrlgaunts are powerful carnivores that eat most things but seem to have a strong preference for the taste of humanoids and mountain rams, taking special enjoyment in the consumption of bone, horn, and marrow. An irlgaunt&apos;s gizzard, located near its upper orifice, is powerful enough to grind rock, creating shards of stone which the creature fires from its mouth. The resulting stone shards are combined into gastroliths-sizable, dense spheres of sharp stones veined with jellified digestive acids. These gastroliths not only help the creature grind apart the hard substances it digests, but also can be shot forth as weapons, felling and pre-digesting sizable or even flying prey. Gastroliths are under constant pressure within an irlgaunt&apos;s body and, once shot forth, prove quite fragile. Upon impacting a victim or any other surface, they shatter in a rain of rock shards and hissing acid.\n\nIrlgaunts are found on and around mountains, especially near narrow trails used by travelers, mountain dwellers, or herds of sure-footed animals. The rocky environment they inhabit matches the colors of their bodies, and their uncanny ability to blend into the terrain and attack from unexpected angles makes them skilled ambush hunters. The tough limbs of an irlgaunt end in nimble, muscular tendrils. Along with being able to seek out and cling to nearly imperceptible flaws in stone, these tendrils also secrete a potent, stone-digesting acid much like that found within the beasts&apos; gizzards. This acid allows irlgaunts not only to burn holes into solid stone, but to shape stone into whatever form they desire.\n\nIrlgaunts live for up to 300 years and reproduce asexually every half-century. They take special care to protect their offspring for this reason and watch over them for about a year, at which point the adolescent reaches maturity.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nIrlgaunts are not particularly social creatures, but they work together when doing so is mutually beneficial. In smaller numbers, irlgaunts are more likely to live in more remote areas, while larger groups may occupy more commonly traveled mountain passes.\n\nIrlgaunts sometimes share their habitat with giants native to the region, but do so through an unspoken truce that holds little weight. A single giant walking through an area of several irlgaunts, then, is no safer than a solitary irlgaunt prowling a region populated with giants. Yet neither group goes out of its way to provoke a dangerous feud with its powerful, mountain dwelling neighbors- as long as the other group is generally content to stay out of the way.\n\nTreasure means little to irlgaunts, though if they possess a relic or magic item, they use it as bait for sentient wanderers in the region. For this reason, particularly wealthy and well-guarded travelers or merchants may be able to parley with the aberrations, exchanging riches for safe passage.\n\nIrlgaunts are largely indifferent to religion. However, some spiritually inclined irlgaunts choose to follow Rovagug, and some even become priests in his name. In such cases, a group or family of irlgaunts tend to worship the same god. Those rare irlgaunts that do worship Rovagug often take an almost personal interest in freeing the imprisoned god, delving deep into the earth and creating new abysses covered in profane images and symbols of the monstrous deity. The hope seems to be that should enough cracks be cut into the depths, Rovagug&apos;s prison deep beneath the surface might weaken enough for the god of destruction to break free. The futility of such efforts seems to matter little to the aberrations, which appear to care more about the symbolism of their destructive actions." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruWarsworn" name="Warsworn" description="Warsworns are massive, undead amalgams, their evershifting, chaotic bodies composed of countless deceased soldiers and their armor and weapons. Their shambling, serpentine forms tower over giants, and when warsworns move, the monsters create a grotesque, metallic cacophony as the weapons and armor of countless souls clash as though still in the throes of a never-ending battle.\n\nThe history of warsworns is an odd one; the divinely created monstrosities&apos; origins are as disturbing as their image suggests. Deities occasionally turn their attention to the ruined sites of great battles. Some morbid gods, like Urgathoa or Zon-Kuthon, gather the bodies of the slain into horrific, conscious heaps to torment the living, being fickle in their maliciousness and refusing to let the torment and terror of battle die away with the fleetingness of mortal life. Other warmongering deities, like Gorum or Asmodeus, take a more personal hand in the outcome of mortal conflicts, and should their favored armies fall, they might raise them anew to again confront their foes. Yet in still other instances, the passions of battle and tumult of lost lives simply refuse to die away when a conflicts ends, and they are reanimated from the bodies of disappointed soldiers, giving terrible new life to their bloodlust and wrath. Regardless of what forces, divine or otherwise, animate these terrors anew, warsworns exist seemingly for the sole purpose of spreading the rage of war, ravaging the land, and spreading the carnage of battle cries and clashing steel.\n\nA single warsworn, composed of innumerable fallen humanoids, pieces of armor, and weapons, typically weighs several tons and can reach a height of up to 25 feet.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nAs undead creatures, warsworns have no bodily needs, such as for food or water, and they exist solely to destroy and cause chaos. Unknown to many, however, is the fact that warsworns often begin undeath at a much smaller size than is usually seen. Initially only as big as a common wagon, the unimpressive mounds shift across the warstained field from which they were born, rolling onto the scattered corpses and debris, consuming the sordid scene in a matter of hours, at which point they often reach their formidable, ordinarily seen size. Therefore, it is not uncommon for holy warriors, upon hearing news of a battle-stricken land allegedly infested by a warsworn, to rush to the site in the hope of overcoming the monster before it has time to reach its full potential.\n\nHowever, warsworns are frighteningly quick to grow, and most come to a kind of monstrous, unliving maturity before being destroyed. Once the battleground has been scraped clean of its dead, warsworns, never satiated, take to the surrounding area, searching hungrily for more dead to consume, and often invading small towns or villages to create the corpses themselves. They take ironic pleasure in destroying military settlements, bringing the wars of yesteryear roaring back to the unsuspecting people-a brutal, animate reminder that the dead never forget.\n\nAlthough warsworns have little concern for what or whom they destroy, they seem to favor consuming soldiers, victims of war, or at the very least those who die with blade and shield in hand-as if not just seeking new bodies to add to its monstrous girth, but also desirous of some remnant of rage or battle lust. Thus, while a warsworn will roll relentlessly onward and devastate with complete disregard, the unsatisfied monster is constantly searching for war-stricken lands, sites of conflict both ancient and fresh, so that it may satisfy its hunger with the broken steel and festering disease of the battlefield.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nWarsworns can be found near areas that have seen great strife or war, especially battlefields, and sometimes make their way toward settlements close to such sites of human destruction. Warsworns, while intelligent, have little need for alliances, as their incredible size and strength provides all the muscle they require to wreak as much havoc as possible.\n\nDespite appearing as little more than a tide of zombies, these undead are driven on by more than mindless rage, retaining some communal memory of a soldier&apos;s tactics and a brawler&apos;s instincts. Proving to be surprisingly canny in battle, warsworns make use of every element of their necrotic bodies, including the splintered metal and rusting plates within their forms. The abominations have been known to launch great masses of rusting metal and shattered bone from their innermost hallows, balls of scrap propelled forth as if from a gigantic hellish catapult. Many of the creatures&apos; grasping limbs also bear the remains of weapons, but such armaments rarely survive the undead thing&apos;s constant grinding motion, which reduces them to little more than lengths of dull metal amid the warsworn&apos;s thrashing, body-sized limbs.\n\nUnsleeping and unrelenting, warsworns are almost always on the move. Thus, warsworns might stop their rampage or even retreat for strategic means, waiting until nightfall to strike the people of a settlement near the site of a battle-the warsworns&apos; most infamous and commonly utilized tactic. Farming communities located near vast stretches of fields that were once the site of a skirmish are often victim to warsworns&apos; sudden, unpredictable attacks." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruAnkou" name="Ankou" description="Death is a passing inconvenience to the folk of the First World. If a fey is slain in its home realm, it reforms sometime later from the mutable stuff of reality. To them, violence and mayhem are somewhere between a sport and a mode of criticism. If a fey lord chops the head off one of his knights, it might be little more than a dramatic rebuke.\n\nTherefore, the creatures known as ankous should not be considered simple killers. Their duty is not merely to kill-it is to terrify and torture, to wring every iota of suffering out of their target in a pageant of cruelty before the final act, the bloody murder itself. Ankous are the servants of powerful fey nobles who rule with cold-iron fists, and whose subjects live in terror of a visit from the dark ones. They cannot permanently kill those of the First World, but they can make victims long for oblivion.\n\nPhysically, ankous are a fearful sight-that is, when they permit themselves to be seen, instead of blinding their foes with darkness. The ankous themselves never speak-the only words they can utter are those whispered telepathically into the victim&apos;s ear an instant before death, and those words are spoken in the voice of the one who sent the killer.\n\nA typical ankou measures approximately 10 feet tall, and about 8 feet across its ebon wings. Exceedingly light, the dark fey seem to be made of little more than shadows and gossamer, weighing less than 100 pounds.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nServants of the Eldest, ankous exist to mete out the displeasure of their masters. The wounds caused by its wings and tail are especially agonizing, and victims have described little shards of crystalline moonlight cutting their way through muscle and bone underneath the skin. The blood-drenched skin of the victim of an ankou occasionally seems to shimmer or sparkle as if from residual moonlight in the corpse. Regardless of whether or not such dreadful whimsy is true, the wounds dealt by an ankou&apos;s tail and wings prove particularly vicious, leaving some victims to slowly bleed out from what appears to be nothing more than a mere scratch.\n\nThe fey&apos;s most horrific power, though, is its ability to conjure lesser shadows of itself. The assassin can create duplicates to aid in its attack. A single ankou can block all the exits from a chamber, ripping a victim to shreds with a flurry of slashes from the same claw. These conjured fey are born of shadow and wrath, and are of one mind with the ankou that created them. These lesser copies vanish when the true ankou is killed or is otherwise unable to maintain its focus. Only powerful Eldest can block an ankou&apos;s generation of duplicates.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nAnkous have no true culture of their own. When not hunting a foe, an ankou slumbers in a cocoon of darkness amid the most shadowy reaches of the First World. They are rarely called to service by their fey masters, as the mere threat of an ankou is often enough to terrify even the most fearless enemy. When loosed upon an especially hated foe, one of these assassins might be told to kill the victim many times over-murdering its target, waiting for its connection to the First World to reform it, and then killing it again.\n\nAmid the courts of the Eldest, ankous typically lurk as present but needless threats-like weapons hung in a royal hall. While the Eldest themselves prove more than capable of dispatching those who displease them, the flocks of ebonwinged fey nonetheless prove disturbing. What most nonfey typically have difficulty understanding is the lack of malice inherent in assassinations meted out by ankous. On the First World, such acts shock and annoy, but they don&apos;t equate to the ultimate punishment that death presents to mortals of the Material Plane. Thus, these grim tormenters of the First World take on new aspects of terror when encountered by non-natives of that realm.\n\nIn the unlikely event that an ankou&apos;s master is permanently killed, the murderous fey wanders as it will. Moody and quick to take offense-whether from the pestering of other inquisitive fey or from trespassers into lands it deems its own-a free ankou proves even more murderous than one employed as an assassin, though far less concerned with repeated murders. Typically they prefer to be left in silent solitude, brooding amid ancient ruins, crumbling castles of forgotten fey lords, or other morbid demesnes. They take particular umbrage at those who bring light or, even worse, song into their dour realms, often resorting to brief tortures before slaying such interlopers. Unfortunately for ankous, daredevil fey pranksters who discover their lairs often make a grim game of invading and taunting these murderous beings, eventually forcing the assassins to relocate to even more unreachable depths of the First World.\n\nNumerous ankous once served the Eldest known as Count Ranalc, whose disappearance has long been a matter of debate, wonder, and lurking fear among his immortal brethren and other strange lords of the First World. Devoted to his service and in the fulfillment of some unknowable past order, the ankous of his court have sought their master, slaying many they believe have had some hand in his disappearance or knowledge of his whereabouts. In the past decades, these murderous fey have come to investigate Golarion, believing that world bears some mark of their lost lord&apos;s passage. Whether or not this is true, and whether Golarion now serves as a hiding place for the lost Eldest or merely a step on a greater path, none the ankous have encountered can say-though that hasn&apos;t prevent the deadly fey from ending those who arouse their suspicions" compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruSkrikNet" name="Skrik Nettle" description="Shoals of skrik nettles float through the skies of the First World. They sail like boats, driven before the wind and using their feathers to tack and turn. They sing as they fly, jabbering and chirping to each other in complex harmonies. The average skrik nettle shoal consists of three dozen or more of the majestic creatures, but these flocks are often split up during the roaring storms so common to the First World. Lone skrik nettles may be encountered in smaller numbers, confused and trying to find their way back to their kin.\n\nSkrik nettles range in size from a few inches across (for a newly spawned hatchling) to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds. Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nSkrik nettles are primarily scavengers, although they will attack suitable prey when hungry. Their method of attack is curious. The sharp beaks of a skrik nettle drip with a magical poison that is injected when the creature bites a foe. The victim of the poison feels slightly nauseous and light-headed at first-and then begins to float off the ground.\n\nAs long as the poison pumps through the veins of the skrik nettle&apos;s victim, the victim keeps floating up into the sky. The victim has no control over this magical levitation-unless she has some other method of controlling her flight, such as wings or magic, or she can grab a convenient tree branch, she will keep ascending until the poison wears off and gravity takes hold once more. The skrik nettles usually float up alongside their prey, keeping it floating by injecting more poison as soon as it starts to drop. Especially dangerous or hardshelled prey might be poisoned, allowed to rise, and then dropped repeatedly from a height until dead.\n\nThe poison&apos;s effects seem to be rooted in magic, rather than venom, and dispelling the ailment has proven to be just as effective as bleeding a victim. Before aiding a victim, however, one must take caution to tie said creature down securely, as there are few deaths more ironic than being cured of a skrik nettle&apos;s poison only to instantly plunge to earth from a great height. Oddly, in addition to traditional remedies, killing a skrik nettle also instantly cancels the effects of its poison.\n\nOnce every year, skrik nettles return to their shoal&apos;s spawning grounds to reproduce. The jellyfish-like creatures form hard, rugged eggs inside their bodies, then float gently down to the spawning ground-usually a jungle clearing or warm swamp-and dig nests with their tentacles. Skrik nettles are hermaphrodites, so each one lays its eggs and then fertilizes those of its neighbor (this cross-breeding strengthens future generations of skrik nettles). The average skrik nettle lays three or four eggs, whose size ranges from that of a clenched fist to that of a giant&apos;s skull.\n\nThese eggs incubate in the warm earth for several days, during which time the skrik nettles patrol above the spawning ground, attacking anyone who might disturb the eggs. When ready to hatch, the eggs explode out of the ground and shoot into the sky, bursting into a swarm of newborn skrik nettles. Unwary travelers who slip past the patrolling skrik nettles can trigger a premature hatching if they walk over the spawning ground; such travelers may be pummeled by flying, rock-hard egg shards, or even carried into the sky by a particularly large hatchling.\n\nHatchling skrik nettles are ravenously hungry when born. To provide for the needs of their young, skrik nettle shoals assemble caches of poisoned meat and float them over the spawning ground. A wary explorer can spot a spawning ground from afar if she notices rotting corpses hanging overhead. Skrik nettle eggs can often be sold to the fey. Some train young skrik nettles as songbirds, teaching all six beaks to sing in harmony. Others wrap skrik nettle eggs in cloth filled with golden dust or brightly colored pollen; when an egg prepared in such a manner flies into the sky and explodes upon hatching, the cloth&apos;s contents scatter across the sky like a beautiful firework. Such entertainments are popular at parties-though the ensuing swarm of carnivorous jellyfish swooping down on the guests is considered less enchanting.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nSkrik nettles dwell amid the clouds, descending only to feed and procreate. They use their songs to keep the shoal together, flying toward the chirping music of their kin. Bards are often able to lure skrik nettles down to them with their enchanting melodies, but once within range, the poisonous creatures usually trade this performance for a live meal.\n\nSkrik nettles are not especially intelligent predators-thus, they eat the bounty of the land, or, if particularly lucky, snatch a dead or weak creature from the ground. While skittish, they retaliate when attacked, regarding the assault as a chance to feed. Settlements in regions where skrik nettle migrations are common usually keep a few sacrificial animals handy to lure the skrik nettles away during a hunt. The one exception is where the skrik nettle&apos;s spawning grounds are involved-during the time before a hatching, the skrik nettle shoal patrols the area around the spawning grounds and viciously attacks any trespassers. Skrik nettles are also a hazard to flyers. They lurk in low-hanging clouds, letting their tendrils trail down out of the mist. An unwary bird or flying creature can be stung, grabbed, and whisked off to be eaten in a matter of seconds. When scavenging, they fly at a low level above the landscape, letting their tendrils play over the ground as they search for carrion.\n\nSkrik nettles themselves have few natural predators. They are reputed to taste so light and airy that eating one is like trying to eat a soap bubble, albeit a soap bubble with a half-dozen stinging beaks. Skrik nettles perceive the world by sensing air currents and shifting vibrations through their sensitive tentacles; during storms or strong winds, they secure themselves in the forks of large trees and wait out the harsh weather.\n\nSome fey hunt the skrik nettle shoals in little flying boats for sport, bringing them down with weighted nets or leaden harpoons. A few fey even try riding skrik nettles, &#147;docking&#148; them to make them harmless by clamping their beaks shut and then hanging a saddle from the tentacles, but the creatures are too weak to make good steeds. It is also the fashion in some regions for noble faerie-maidens to be accompanied by a small flock of &#147;docked&#148; skrik nettles, each one bearing a fan, mirror, or basket of fruit in its tentacles. Others capture skrik nettles and train them to speak-the skrik nettles are not intelligent, but they can be taught to imitate the speech of the First World, much like parrots can learn to imitate human tongues. A trained skrik nettle can even hold conversations with itself, with each of its half-dozen tentacles imitating a different voice." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruZomok" name="Zomok" description="The First World&apos;s seasons are as random as any other aspect of that strange realm, with summers lasting for years or winters passing in an afternoon. Many of the forests of that world, some of them surprisingly similar to those on Golarion, have difficulty coping with the unpredictable climate. These forests often survive only because they&apos;re inhabited by zomoks: plant-dragons that prowl the woodlands, defending them from the often destructive forces of that realm, and healing and regrowing vegetation as needed. Through the ages, some of these creatures have even traveled from the First World to inhabit the wilds of other realities, protecting the nature of such lands from disasters and axe blades just as tenaciously as they would in their homeland.\n\nNo two zomoks look alike, and rarely does one creature look the same for long; parts of their bodies are constantly growing, dying off, and regenerating from nearby plants in an endless cycle. Most rise to a height of 18 feet and stretch at least 35 feet long, with wingspans of more than 80 feet and weights of 30 tons.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nA zomok is more than just a single creature, being closer to a collective spirit of the woodlands. One might step into one stand of trees and reform a new body elsewhere in the forest, the same creature but with a different body. The shape of a zomok is different each time it arises. On one occasion, it might pick a sturdy larch as its right foreleg and turn a weeping willow into its head; on another, it could have a body of oak and make its teeth from brambles and nettles. The overall shape is always draconic, but its components change, even from moment to moment. In truth, it is more a dragon-shaped wave moving through the forest-the trees bend momentarily into the dragon&apos;s body and limbs, but the wave passes on, leaving them intact in its wake.\n\nZomoks do not need to eat and have no real digestive system. Any creatures they happen to devour whole are often found hanging in bloody gobbets from the topmost branches of random trees, though the hungry plants of the realm often consume the remains before they are ever found.\n\nIn combat, zomoks prefer to keep moving, using their tree stride ability to ensure that no one stand of trees takes the brunt of the injuries. To protect their habitat, zomoks breathe a raging torrent of thorns, twigs, chunks of bark, and clouds of moss that envelops those in its path, encasing them in a thick shroud of organic matter. Those slain by the breath weapon are instantly decomposed into rich loam; even those who survive often find mold growing on their skin or small plants sprouting from their hair or ears, with each tendril trying to root the creature into the earth.\n\nZomoks can also control the terrain, turning the land into a swamp or conjuring defensive walls. When need be, they can quench flames at will-a useful talent for a creature so vulnerable to fire. When facing powerful foes, zomoks create mighty walls of briar and moves through the wood to divide its enemies and attack them individually. Zomoks can also call up formidable guardians of mold and vines using magic, and it is rare for them to be without such defending monsters. Some zomoks even consume their shambling minions, holding them in their bodies so any creatures the dragon-plants swallow are assaulted inside of them as well as out.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nThough zomoks do not inhabit every forest in the First World, they are far from uncommon, and they offer the benefit of protecting nature and its denizens wherever they may go.\n\nThe finicky zomok&apos;s temperament varies with the season. In spring, they are often playful and mercurial, playing pranks on intruders or changing forest paths to confuse travelers. In summer, zomoks find their strength and majesty and become kings of the woodland, attending courts with dryads, satyrs, and stranger folk of the green. In autumn, zomoks become weird mystics, spouting prophecies and cryptic mutterings about the fate of the forest. Only the most foolish would dare approach a zomok in winter, when starvation and the chill of the frost make them vicious and cruel. A zomok wearing its winter coat of rime-covered branches and gray moss can be placated with suitable sacrifices, such as broken axe-heads or nubile virgins with green thumbs.\n\nZomoks have a slightly bemused attitude toward other creatures dwelling in their woods, considering them pets at best and pesky parasites at worst. In any event, the mobile nature of a zomok&apos;s woodland territory means that there are few longterm residents within the dragon&apos;s demesne, although some zomoks have forged extended alliances with dryads, bringing the dryads&apos; trees along each time they move. Like most woodland fey, they despise those who harm trees-woe betide any who set axe or fire to wood in the presence of a zomok. Despite this, threatening the forest is often the best way to deal with such a monster. Actually killing a zomok is difficult because of its ability to heal itself through tree striding, so a better tactic is to blast the surrounding woods with fireballs or blights until the plant-dragon agrees to negotiate.\n\nUnlike true dragons, zomoks have little interest in treasure, but a few coins or other items may sometimes be found lodged in the branches and roots of the creatures&apos; innards." compset="Race">

  <thing id="ruDrekavac" name="Drekavac" description="Drekavacs are the undead remains of children who perished from disease, particularly in plague-ridden areas where many such deaths occurred in a short period of time. Able to become as insubstantial as the mist rising from a graveyard on a cold, dark night, drekavacs are carriers of disease, seeking to infect the living with the afflictions that slew them. According to some stories, drekavacs only result from young plague victims who remain unburied or died bereft of the proper funeral rites; performing those rites may allow their spirits to rest and no longer haunt the world of the living.\n\n{b}Ecology{/b}\nDrekavacs typically haunt desolate places, from windswept plains and mountains to dark forests and abandoned homes or villages. They may move among inhabited areas in gaseous form, but are typically warded off by bright lights and the sounds and sights of life. They are always encountered indoors or at night, preferring dark, cloudy or foggy nights, ideally during the waning moon. Drekavacs are usually encountered during the gloomy, cold winter months rather than in the spring or summer.\n\nRural clerics and adepts must sometimes deal with one or more drekavacs seeking to spread disease in their communities. Their favored targets are children, some of whom can also become drekavacs 3 days after death unless their bodies are burned and the ashes scattered. The work of drekavacs in a community can sometimes lead to hysterical accusations by grief-stricken parents and families, stirring up resentment and violence toward outsiders or anyone suspected of involvement with unnatural forces.\n\nIt is customary in some rural areas to surround a child&apos;s crib with a ring of blessed salt to keep evil influences at bay, including drekavacs, who cannot cross an unbroken line of salt. However, drekavacs can convince others to break the line of salt for them.\n\n{b}Habitat &amp; Society{/b}\nDrekavacs are lonesome, bitter, and pitiful creatures, often crying when they appear, mourning their lost lives. Some folk mistake them for living children, lost or starving, although the creatures are not very effective liars. Still, a dim night and a half-seen form huddled and sobbing pitifully are often enough to trick someone into approaching close enough to become victim of the drekavac&apos;s chilling grasp.\n\nOnce they have inflicted their plagues upon victims, drekavacs quickly lose interest and move on, although they may follow a victim, begging for aid and attention, behaving as if they were still living victims of disease rather than its agents. They rarely kill victims outright, preferring instead to inflict long and lingering deaths through disease. Drekavacs threatened with salt, magic, or silver weapons become vicious, attacking opponents like snarling dogs until they are dead or the creatures are driven off.\n\nDrekavacs sometimes band together in small packs, particularly in places where epidemics or plagues have swept through a population, either recently or long ago, but they have no real organization beyond seeking out new victims to infect. Drekavacs are intelligent and aware, able to converse in Common, or whatever languages they knew in life. This means some drekavacs are only able to communicate in largely dead or forgotten languages. They are childlike in their understanding and largely incapable of being reasoned with, but deft use of Bluff or Diplomacy and a playful or parental tone may keep a drekavac at bay, at least temporarily." compset="Race">
