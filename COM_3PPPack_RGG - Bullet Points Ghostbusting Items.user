  <thing id="ioGIPktCfn" name="Pocket Coffin" description="This miniature brass coffin is approximately the size of a wizard&#146;s spellbook, and is covered in arcane runes of warding, repose, and silence. Each pocket coffin has a hook (to allow it to hang easily from a belt or harness) and a 20-foot silken lanyard cord. \n\nWhen an undead has been destroyed (reduced to 0 hit points), the pocket coffin can be used to absorb its unliving essence, to ensure the malign entity\ndoes not return to the mortal world. The coffin must be placed at the location of the undead&#146;s death, and if the undead has a physical corpse or receptacle\nfor its soul (such as a lich&#146;s phylactery) that must also be present. The miniature brass coffin opens in a flash of light, sucks in the undead&#146;s essence, and\nslams shut. As long as the pocket coffin is shut, the undead cannot reform or remanifest. Pocket coffins do not have any sort of built-in lock &#150; they cannot\nbe opened by a spirit they contain, but any creature handling it can easily flip the lid open to release the spirit within.\n\nA pocket coffin can hold only one spirit at a time. If an old spirit is released, the pocket coffin can be used to capture a new undead spirit. Legends suggest the spirits trapped in a pocket coffin can be unloaded into an artifact known as the Cabinet of Spirits, but if such an artifact ever existed it is long-since lost.\n\nConstruction Requirements: \nCraft Wondrous Item, lesser planar ally, sanctify corpse; Cost: 5,000 gp" compset="Wondrous">

  <thing id="ioGISpctrl" name="Spectral Torch" description="A spectral torch appears to be a burned-out stump of a torch that has been banded in cold iron rings covered in arcane runes. Under normal circumstances a very faint wisp of smoke trails continuously up from the torch, though it never gives off light or heat. However, when the torch is brought near locations where undead are, or have recently been (even incorporeal undead), the amount of smoke produced increases and changes color. By waving the torch about and following where it produces the most smoke, it is possible to find and sometimes even track  undead. By learning what colors of smoke are produced by the trail of which undead, a user can sometimes identify what undead created each trail the torch detects. \n\nEfforts to find and track undead are handled by treating anyone holding the torch as if he had the scent special ability, only against undead (and effective against incorporeal undead). A character can also make a Knowledge (religion) check at -10 to identify the undead being tracked by the smoke the torch produces. Each time that character successfully identifies an undead after seeing the torches&#146; reaction to it (even if this is just by following the torch until the undead is encountered) this penalty is reduced by 1, to a minimum penalty of -2. \n\nConstruction Requirements: \nCraft Wondrous Item, dancing lantern, detect undead; Cost: 1,250 gp" compset="Wondrous">
