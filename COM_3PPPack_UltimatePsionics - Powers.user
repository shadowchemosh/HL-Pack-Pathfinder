If something happens to you during the journey that causes you to break hand-to-hand contact, your companions are stranded wherever you leave them. Because the planes are a dangerous place, those who lead astral caravans usually choose to manifest this power only if they have a large party of travelers assembled. Sometimes groups of lower-level adventurers may hire you to lead forays beyond the Material Plane.\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nYou can take an additional number of companions equal to your mythic tier, and the manifester level check to dispel your mythic astral caravan is increased by an amount equal to your mythic tier. If a mythic creature using mythic astral caravan has its astral body killed, it may expend one use of its mythic power to gain only one permanent negative level rather than two.\n{b}Augmented (6th):{/b} If you expend one additional use of mythic power per creature, you can surround each of the physical bodies of creatures left behind within an individual wall of force that lasts as long as the mythic astral caravan does unless it is destroyed." compset="PsiPower" summary="You lead {i}astral traveler{/i}-enabled group to a planar destination.">

  <thing id="puAstSeed8" name="Astral Seed" description="This power weaves strands of astral ectoplasm into a crystal containing the seed of your living mind (hardness 1 and 1 hit point). You can have only one astral seed in existence at any one time. Until such time as you perish, the astral seed (also called the storage crystal) is utterly inert. If you are slain at some later date, your soul transfers into the storage crystal, which begins to dimly glow.\n     Upon transference, your physical remains (should they still exist) become inert matter and cannot thereafter be restored to life. The transfer from the slain body to the astral seed works over any distance, physical or extradimensional.\n     Once your body&apos;s physical demise activates the storage crystal, you have the abilities of a psicrystal of the appropriate level, plus all the powers you knew and the maximum power points you possessed when astral seed was manifested-but you also have a negative level that cannot be healed and that does not convert to real level loss in your current crystalline form. You have thirty days to grow an organic body, after which time your sentience fades and your soul passes on if it hasn&apos;t entered a new body.\n     To grow a body, you (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in uninterrupted solitude. The body&apos;s constituent parts are pulled as ectoplasm from the Astral Plane, then slowly molded and transformed into a living, breathing body that is an exact duplicate of your body at the time you manifested astral seed (the crystal itself breaks down and becomes a part of the new organic body). When the tenth day ends, you completely and totally inhabit the new body. You possess all the abilities you possessed when astral seed was manifested, but you have none of your equipment.  You still suffer a negative level that does not fade unless removed by means such as restoration.\n     If the body is struck for any amount of damage during the ten-day period when it is growing, it is destroyed and your soul passes on. \n     Conceivably, you could manifest mind switch to utilize a temporary body, but only an evil creature would smash his own temporarily empty storage crystal to permanently usurp a subject&apos;s organic body (unless the subject is itself irredeemably evil).\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nThe amount of time to reform your body is reduced to one day and do not suffer a negative level when you reform in your new body. \n{b}Augmented:{/b} If you expend one use of mythic power, you reform with all the abilities you possessed when killed, rather than when mythic astral seed was manifested.\n{b}Augmented (3rd):{/b} If you expend one use of mythic power, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around your body as it is creating, protecting it from potential harm.

  <thing id="puClawBea1" name="Claws of the Beast" description="{b}Power Points{/b}: see text.\n\nYou call forth the aggressive nature of the beast inherent in yourself,\npsionically transforming your hands into deadly claws. You gain two natural attacks with your claws, each dealing 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if you are Large, or 1d3 if you are Small) plus your Strength bonus.  Your claws are natural weapons, so you are considered armed when attacking with them, and they can be affected by powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve natural weapons. You can choose to deal nonlethal damage with your claws, taking the standard –4 penalty on your attack roll.\n\nYour claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no penalties for two-weapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack unless you are using manufactured weapons in the same round, in which case any claw not used to wield a weapon is considered a secondary attack (just like any other creature which uses both manufactured and natural weapons). If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks-you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus. You may use secondary natural attacks as normal when using your claw attacks as part of a full attack.  \n\nYou can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power on your turn before you attack. Manifesting this power is a swift action. You cannot manifest this power when it isn&apos;t your turn.\n\nYou can call or dismiss the claws as a swift action during the duration of the power. If you attack with a manufactured weapon or another primary natural attack, you can&apos;t make any claw attacks in that round.  You can still hold and manipulate items with your claws or cast spells just as well as you could with your hands.\n\n{b}Augment:{/b} If you spend additional power points, you can create larger, sharper, and more deadly claws, as shown on the {i}claws of the beast{/i} damage table.\n{b}Claw of the Beast Damage Table{/b}\n{b}Power{/b}      {b}Claw Damage{b}\n{b}Points{/b}    {b}Small{/b}    {b}Medium{/b}    {b}Large{/b}\n    1           1d3         1d4       1d6\n    3           1d4         1d6       1d8\n    5           1d6         1d8       2d6\n    7           1d8         2d6       3d6\n  11           2d6         3d6       4d6\n  15           3d6         4d6       5d6\n  19           4d6         5d6       6d6\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nYour claws’ critical threat range increases to 19-20.

You can force the subject to stand up, sit down, walk, turn around, and so on, but operating the vocal cords is too difficult. You can also hold the subject immobile, rendering it helpless. You cannot force the subject to manifest powers, cast spells, or use any special ability that is not a function of just its body movements.

  <thing id="puContFir1" name="Control Flames" description="You pyrokinetically control the intensity or movements of one fire source. A nonmagical fire source can be controlled if it is equal to or smaller than the maximum size of fire you can control according to your manifester level, as noted on the accompanying table.  You can freely switch control between fire sources, or change the nature of your control, while you maintain concentration, but only one specified change (keeping a fire burning, animating it, or altering its size) can be made to one fire source in a round. When your control over a fire source lapses, that fire immediately returns to its original state (or goes out if it has no fuel or has been moved away from its original location). With this power, you can artificially keep a fire burning that would normally expire for lack of fuel; even dousing a controlled flame with water does not put it out (though completely submerging the flame would). Normally, a creature at risk of catching on fire can avoid this fate by making a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, with success indicating that the fire has gone out. If the fire is one that has been kept burning by the use of control flames, then the DC of the Reflex save needed to put out the flames increases to 25.\n\nThis power also enables you to make a fire move as if it were a living creature. You can animate only a naturally burning fire; if you attempt to animate one that has been increased or decreased in size by your augmentation of this power, the fire immediately returns to its original size. An animated fire moves at a speed of 30 feet. A fire that moves away from its fuel or its original location dies as soon as your control over it lapses.  \n\nAn animated fire can enter any square, even if a creature already occupies it. If an animated fire enters a square occupied by a creature, that creature can make a Reflex save to get out of the way (DC 11 + the number of dice of damage the fire does + your key ability modifier). A successful Reflex save moves the creature to the nearest unoccupied square. The flames deal the indicated damage to any creature that is either on fire or surrounded by the flames (in the fire&apos;s space); see the accompanying table, Psionics Unleased page 89).\n\nAt the start of your turn, the animated fire deals damage to any creature in its space, and the creature catches on fire unless it makes a Reflex save (DC as noted above). A victim on fire takes 1d6 points of damage each round. Additional rounds in the same space as the animated fire occupies mean additional chances of ignition. The damage from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving throw each round to negate each fire. It is possible to switch control from the animated fire (causing it to disappear) to intensify flames that are already burning (thus denying the foe Reflex saves after the first).\n\n{b}Augment:{/b} You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.\n{b}1.{/b} For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can increase the size of a fire you want to control by one step, up to the maximum size of fire you can control according to your manifester level.\n{b}2.{/b} For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can decrease the size of a fire you want to control by one step. You can reduce a Tiny or smaller fire to nothing, extinguishing it.\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nYou can concentrate to maintain the power as a move action instead of as a standard action. You may control a fire one size larger than normal (a 1st level manifester controlling a torch, a 3rd level manifester controlling a small campfire, and so on.) You add your tier to the maximum damage per round dealt by a fire you control.\n{b}Augmented (5th):{/b} If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can control two fires, each of up to your normal maximum fire size." compset="PsiPower" summary="Take control of nearby open flame.">

If multiple manifestations of the {i}control light{/i} power overlaps in an area, the light level is decreased or increased by only one step (or two steps in case of the Burst Increase manifestation).\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nIf using control light to decrease light, the illumination level in the area drops to darkness regardless of the existing lighting conditions. Nonmythic powers and effects can’t increase the light level in the area. Creatures with darkvision and the power to see in darkness have difficulty seeing through this darkness, and can see as well as a human can in dim light. Creatures in the area of darkness take a –2 penalty on saves against fear. \n  If using control light to increase light, the illumination level in the area increases to at least normal light regardless of the existing lighting conditions.

If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual, or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon&apos;s roar), you must succeed on a Bluff check with a +5 circumstance bonus opposed by the intended listener&apos;s Sense Motive check to avoid arousing suspicion.\n\nYou can entirely muffle a noise or magnify a sound to such loudness that it drowns out all other conversation in the immediate area.

The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, but not psionic effects such as a {i}null psionics field.{/i}\n\nA creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.\n\nOnly the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per manifestation.\n\n{b}Augment:{/b} For every additional power point you spend, the damage this power deals to a subject that fails its saving throw increases by 2d6 points. Augmenting this power does not change the amount of damage the target takes if it succeeds on its saving throw. For every 4d6 additional damage, the power&apos;s save DC increases by 1.\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nThe damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of damage per manifester level (maximum 60d6) plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw takes 5d8 points of damage plus 1 point of Constitution damage.\n  A creature whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 by this power is entirely disintegrated. \n{b}Augmented (7th):{/b} If you expend two uses of mythic power, you fire two rays.\n  Alternatively, you may fire only one ray, but if the target is a non-mythic creature and it fails its saving throw, it’s automatically disintegrated regardless of its current hp." compset="PsiPower" summary="Turn one creature or object to dust.">

  <thing id="puDisPsio3" name="Dispel Psionics" description="You can use {i}dispel psionics{/i} to end one ongoing power that has been manifest on a creature or object or to temporarily suppress the psionic abilities of a psionic item. A dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some powers, as detailed in their descriptions, can&apos;t be defeated by {i}dispel psionics{i}. {i}Dispel psionics{/i} can dispel (but not counter) psi-like effects just as it does powers. The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can&apos;t be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already over before the {i}dispel psionics{/i} can take effect.\n\n{i}Targeted Dispel:{/i} One object, creature, or power is the target of the {i}dispel psionics{/i} power. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level) and compare that to the power with highest manifester level (DC = 11 + the power&apos;s manifester level). If successful, that power ends. If not, compare the same result to the power with the next highest manifester level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one power affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every power.\n\nFor example, a 7th-level manifester manifests {i}dispel psionics{/i}, targeting a creature affected by {i}biofeedback{/i} (manifester level 12th) and {i}flight{/i} (manifester level 7th).  The manifester level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the {i}biofeedback{/i} (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the {i}flight{/i} (which only required a 18). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the {i}biofeedback{i} would have been dispelled, leaving the {i}flight{/i} intact. Had the dispel check been a 17 or less, no powers would have been affected.\n\nYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one power affecting the target or one power affecting an area (such as a {i}wall of fire{/i}). You must name the specific power effect to be targeted in this way. If your manifester level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that power, it ends. No other powers or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\n\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power (such as a monster summoned by {i}summon monster{/i}), you make a dispel check to end the power that conjured the object or creature.\n\nIf the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item&apos;s manifester level (DC = 11 + the item&apos;s manifester level). If you succeed, all the item&apos;s psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its psionic properties. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a {i}bag of holding{/i}) is temporarily closed. A psionic item&apos;s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal psionics such as this.\n\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifest yourself.\n\n{b}Augment:{/b} This power may be augmented in one of the following ways.\n{b}1.{/b} If you spend an additional 6 power points, your targeted dispel can dispel one power for every four manifester levels you possess, starting with the highest level powers and proceeding to lower level powers. It also has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if an unaugmented {i}dispel psionics{/i} can&apos;t dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse&apos;s DC.\n{b}2.{/b} If you spend an additional 6 power points, you may choose to make an area dispel instead of a targeted dispel.\n\n{i}Area Dispel:{/i} When {i}dispel psionics{/i} is used in this way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by {i}dispel psionics{/i}. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more powers, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by an area dispel.\n\nFor each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the {i}dispel psionics{i} power, apply the dispel check to dispel the power. For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the {i}dispel psionics{/i} power, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\n\nIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power (such as a weapon summoned by {i}call weaponry{/i}) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the power that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one power targeting the creature or object.\n\nYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any power that you have manifested.\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nWhen used as a targeted dispel, this power can end two effects affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one effect, you heal 1d4 points of damage for every power level of the dispelled effect. If you dispel two effects, this healing applies only to the highest-level effect dispelled." compset="PsiPower" summary="Cancels psionic powers and effects.">

Your duplicate thinks and acts exactly as you do and follows your orders, although it will not do anything you wouldn&apos;t do yourself. Your duplicate has all your abilities but none of your psionic or magical equipment (it does possess a duplicate of all your mundane equipment, clothing, armor, and implements, as well as mundane versions of any psionic or magical equipment you have). You and your duplicate evenly split your power points, your remaining usages of pertinent special abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you maintain such when this power is manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself with a manifester level two lower for the purpose of determining the powers to which the duplicate has access (while the duration of this power lasts, this manifester level penalty cannot be removed by any means). Your duplicate has all other physical traits you had at the time you manifest this power. Powers, spells, or other effects affecting you when you manifest this power do not transfer to your duplicate. Your duplicate has the same number of hit points you did at the time this power was manifested.\n\nWhen the duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from each other you are. You gain back any power points the duplicate has not spent. At the time of rejoining, your hit points become the average between the current hit points of you and your duplicate. This could potentially leave you with negative hit points, but it can&apos;t reduce your hit points so low as to kill you when the duration ends.\n\nIf your duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining occurs, and you gain one negative level and are sickened for ten minutes.

Similarly, attempting to use powers such as {i}claws of the vampire{/i} or {i}vampiric blade{/i} to hurt your duplicate only damages your duplicate; these powers do not heal you. {i}Empathic transfer{/i} and similar powers are likewise ineffective (transferring wounds to yourself isn&apos;t a good healing strategy).\n\nAll beneficial powers affecting a {i}fissioned{/i} creature, either the original or the duplicate, end when the {i}fission{/i} ends.

  <thing id="puGenesis9" name="Genesis" description="{b}Casting Time:{/b} One Week (8 hours/day)7\n\nYou create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes. This power works best when manifested while you are on the Astral Plane.  Manifestation of this power creates a local density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane.  At first, the fledgling plane grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from the surrounding astral ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn&apos;t really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per year).  Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using {i}astral caravan{/i}, {i}plane shift{/i}, or some other power or permanent link that you arrange for separately.\n\nYou determine the environment within the demiplane when you manifest {i}genesis{/i}, reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). You must add these details in some other fashion if you desire. You can&apos;t create lingering psionic effects with this power; you have to add those separately, if desired.  Similarly, you can&apos;t create a demiplane out of esoteric material, such as silver or uranium; you&apos;re limited to stone and dirt. You can&apos;t manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait is as the Material Plane, as do all other traits of the plane reflect those of the Material Plane. Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you can manifest this power again to gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and so on.\n\nAntigenesis: If {i}genesis{/i} is manifested on the Material Plane, the power takes effect and the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a dead spot like a limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level area of inert dust. Living creatures that pass the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly affected, but plants can find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing creatures die quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the area alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains in the dead spot, and it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, plants, and animals.\n\nManifesting genesis is incredibly taxing and you suffer a negative level for the duration of the manifesting time.

  <thing id="puGrafWep3" name="Graft Weapon" description="You attach any melee weapon you can use in one hand-mundane, psionic, or magical-onto the end of one of your arms. The weapon becomes a natural extension of your arm, and that hand blends seamlessly into the shaft, hilt, or head of the weapon. Now that the weapon and you are one, you gain a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls while using the weapon.\n\nThe grafted weapon is considered both a standard weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of effects that distinguish between either weapon type.  For instance, the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon for the purpose of delivering a touch attack with a power in conjunction with the weapon attack.  As with any power (or spell) melee touch attack made in conjunction with a natural weapon attack, the touch attack effect is not delivered unless the natural weapon strikes normally; on a failed attack, the touch power (or spell) is wasted.\n\nFor a creature under the effect of the {i}claws of the beast{/i} power, grafting a weapon means that attacks with this hand deal the base damage of the weapon, instead of the claw upon which the creature normally relies.\n\nWhile your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand and take a –2 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily polymorph or metamorph you can ignore the grafted weapon or alter it normally, at your discretion. If the weapon takes damage, you take damage as well. If you are healed, so is your grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently lose 2 points of Constitution; the ability drain persists until you can restore your natural anatomy (by means of {i}regenerate{/i} or a similar effect).\n\nWhen this power&apos;s duration expires, the grafted weapon falls to the ground and your hand returns.\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nYou add half your mythic tier to the competence bonus on attack and damage rolls. Your grafted weapon bypasses epic damage reduction if it did not already. You do not lose points of Constitution if your weapon is destroyed, but are instead staggered for one round." compset="PsiPower" summary="Your hand is replaced seamlessly by your weapon.">

  <thing id="puMetacon5" name="Metaconcert" description="You link your psychic might with other psionic creatures, creating a composite network more powerful than the sum of its parts. If there are no willing, psionic creatures in the area other than you when you use this power, it fails.\n\nWhen you manifest this power, up to five willing, psionic creatures in the area connect with you into a metaconcert network (a “metanetwork”), a distributed, metaphysical analogue of a psionic manifester. Misty strands of glowing power link the brows of each member in a complex and shifting pattern, and a mental image of each other member appears in the minds of everyone so linked. A number of power points you designate flow from each member (including yourself) into a collective pool.  If a member does not have enough power points to contribute, he drops out of the metaconcert (see below).\n\nOne individual is chosen as the metaconcert conductor by mutual consent of the other members (this is usually the manifester, but doesn&apos;t have to be). Until the power ends, this conductor directs the efforts of the network. Members of a metaconcert can continue to take actions of their own as normal without disrupting the metanetwork, provided they stay within the area (see below).\n\nAll the powers known of each member (except metaconcert) are available to the conductor through the metanetwork. While the conductor may still manifest his own powers as normal, he may instead choose to manifest a power from the metanetwork instead of from his own powers known. If he does so, he must use the power point pool of the metanetwork and may not use any of his feats or class features to modify the manifestation (although items are permitted), but he also gains numerous benefits. When manifesting a power from the metanetwork, his manifester level increases by one for each other metanetwork member (for instance, the normal maximum membership of five members besides the conductor increases the conductor&apos;s manifester level by five). It is obvious to an outsider when the conductor manifests from the metanetwork, as arcs of light pulse between the various members in a scintillating pattern, streaming to the conductor as his power manifests -- this display cannot be hidden.\n\nThe metanetwork also supports its members.  Each member of the metanetwork gains a bonus on saving throws made against spells or powers equal to the number of other members, as the metanetwork distributes incoming magical energy about its nodes. If a spell or power would deal damage or ability damage to the conductor, he may choose to instead distribute it evenly between himself and all willing members. An individual member may decline receiving damage this way on a case-by-case basis (for example, if a {i}metaconcert{/i} consists of the conductor and four other members, one of whom is not willing to receive damage at this time, the conductor may split the incoming damage between himself and the three willing members). Damage split to willing members this way is typeless and empathic in nature. This splitting takes place prior to the effects of other powers or abilities that lessen damage, such as energy resistance or the {i}intellect fortress{/i} power. Spells and powers that are not subject to power resistance cannot have their damage or ability damage split this way, though the saving throw bonus still applies.\n\nOnce the metanetwork forms, the members must remain within the power&apos;s area, and as a group can move at half the slowest member&apos;s speed on the conductor&apos;s turn. This counts as a move action for each member (that is, if the group moves, each member is treated as having used a move action on their next turn). If a member moves outside the area (whether willingly or involuntarily), that individual drops out of the group, and the power point pool of the metanetwork is instantly recalculated.\n\nAll members who leave before a metaconcert ends or is dismissed reclaim a number of power points equal to the metanetwork&apos;s current power point pool divided by the number of members. That same number of points is removed from the metanetwork&apos;s power point pool. If the conductor drops out, the power ends.  When a {i}metaconcert{/i} ends normally or is dismissed, remaining power points in the pool are divided among all the members (the conductor receives the remainder if the points can&apos;t be divided evenly). No creature can leave a metaconcert with more power points than they had when they entered it -- surplus points dissipate as harmless light radiating from the creature&apos;s eyes.\n\n{b}Augment:{/b} For every additional power point you spend, this power&apos;s duration increases by 1 minute.  For every 2 additional power points spent this way, the maximum number of members of the metanetwork increases by one, and the range and radius of the area of effect increase by 5 ft.\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nThe metaconcert conductor can manifest any mythic powers known by members of the metanetwork and gains an additional bonus to his manifester level equal to your tier. Members of the metanetwork gain a bonus on saving throws equal to your mythic tier. Hit point and ability damage is reduced by your tier before it is distributed.\n{b}Augmented:{/b} If you expend one use of mythic power, members of the metanetwork may spend a swift action to add more power points into the metanetwork’s power point pool." compset="PsiPower" summary="Mental concert of two or more increases the total power of the participants.">

The subject&apos;s senses are all completely fabricated from within its own mind, though it may not realize this.

  <thing id="puMindCon4" name="Mind Control" description="You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject&apos;s mind.\n\nIf you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “Come here,” “Go there,” “Fight,” and “Stand still.” You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.\n\nOnce you have given a controlled creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject&apos;s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).\n\nChanging your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.\n\nBy concentrating fully on the power (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can&apos;t telepathically communicate with you. You can&apos;t actually see through the subject&apos;s eyes, so it&apos;s not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what&apos;s going on.\n\nSubjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.\n\nIf you don&apos;t spend at least 1 round concentrating on the power each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the mind control.\n\nProtection from evil or a similar effect can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect does not automatically dispel it.\n\n{b}Augment:{/b} You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.\n{b}1.{/b} If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can also affect an animal, fey, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.\n{b}2.{/b} If you spend 4 additional power points, this power can also affect an aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in addition to the creature types mentioned above.\n{b}3.{/b} For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect an additional target.

You can give orders to the target even if it’s protected by non-mythic effects that block magical control, such as protection from evil. If the target is protected by a mythic effect, you can attempt to overcome this defense with a manifester level check (DC 15 plus the manifester level of the effect); add your tier to your roll and the opposing manifester’s tier to the DC. If the target succeeds at its Will save to break your control, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to force it to reroll the save and use the lower result." compset="PsiPower" summary="Control target telepathically.">

  <thing id="puMindSed8" name="Mind Seed" description="You impress the totality of your psyche into a subject&apos;s subconscious. If successfully implanted, the seed of your mind “germinates” over the period of one week. During this time, the subject begins to unconsciously take on your mannerisms.\n\nWhen integration is complete (after one week), the subject becomes you in mind as you were when you manifested the power, but the subject&apos;s level is eight lower than your own. The subject does not have any of your physical ability scores or equipment, but does have the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores you had when you were eight levels lower. The subject also knows the powers you knew when you were eight levels lower.\n\nWhile the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two personalities diverge over time. Although the subject starts off with memories of your experiences, it possesses its original “soul” and physical body and is free to develop its own personality based on its own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave or servant, but instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your earlier memories.\n\n{i}Protection from evil{/i} or a similar spell or power can\nprevent you from implanting {i}mind seed{/i}, or prevent a\nseed from germinating while the protective power lasts.\nOtherwise, a germinating seed can be removed (prior to\ngermination) only by {i}psychic chirurgery{/i}, {i}reality revision{/i},\nor similarly high-level effects. Manifesting {i}mind seed{/i}\nagain during the germination period also cleanses the\nsubject&apos;s mind and does not carry with it the restriction\nof a target of your size or smaller\n\nThe process of impressing your psyche into another is demanding and draining. You suffer one negative level that does not go away until cleansed by an effect such as {i}restoration{/i}. Cleansing a {i}mind seed{/i} does not bestow this penalty.\n\nThe target of this power must be your size or smaller.

If the subject&apos;s body dies while you are in it, you are dead. The subject immediately suffers one permanent negative level, but otherwise survives the experience in your natural body.

Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&apos;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three manifester levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all powers where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is power resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and power resistance.\n\nYou must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or psionic energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\n\nTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this power. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.\n\n{i}Familiarity:{/i} “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you&apos;ve been there often.  “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using powers such as remote viewing.\n\n“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you.  When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\n\n{i}On Target:{/i} You appear where you want to be.\n\n{i}Off Target:{/i} You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\n\n{i}Similar Area:{/i} You wind up in an area that&apos;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the power&apos;s range, the power simply fails instead.\n\n{i}Mishap:{/i} You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up.

  <thing id="puQuintes4" name="Quintessence" description="You collapse a bit of time from the continuum, forming a 1-ounce dollop of thick, gooey material called quintessence. This substance shimmers like a silver mirror when viewed from some angles but is transparent from other viewpoints. You can smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object.\n\nObjects sealed within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms, they enter a state of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with quintessence is also partially pulled out of the time stream (the manifester is immune to this effect). This disruption deals 1 point of damage per round beginning 10 rounds after partial contact occurs.\n\nQuintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the time stream.  When you do this, there is a 75% chance that the quintessence evaporates back into the continuum.  Otherwise, it coalesces again into a 1-inch-diameter bead, available for later use.\n\nLarge quantities of quintessence could theoretically be gathered to preserve large items or structures (or even a complete living creature; if completely immersed, a living creature would not take the damage associated with partial contact). However, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because accumulations of quintessence weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity within a 5-foot radius of the accumulation: Powers require twice as many power points to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful Will save each time he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these circumstances, manifesting a psi-like ability that is usable at will is a full-round action rather than a standard action.\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nYou create an additional number of ounces of quintessence equal to your tier.

If you read the thoughts of a creature with an Intelligence of 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round and the power ends.

A {i}reality revision{/i} can produce any one of the following effects.\n\n• Duplicate any psion power of 8th level or lower, provided the power is not on a discipline-restricted list that you do not have access to.\n\n• Duplicate any psion power of 7th level or lower even if it&apos;s a power on a discipline-restricted list that you do not have access to.\n\n• Duplicate any other power or spell of 6th level or lower, such as a psychic warrior power.\n\n• Undo the harmful effects of many other powers, such as {i}microcosm{/i}, {i}geas/quest{/i}, or {i}insanity{/i}.\n\n• Create a non-psionic item of up to 25,000 gp in value.\n\n• Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five {i}reality revisions{/i} manifested in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score. Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be negated or dispelled.  An inherent bonus cannot exceed +5 for a single ability score. Inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack; only the best one applies.\n\n• Remove injuries and afflictions. A single {i}reality revision{/i} can aid one creature per manifester level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction.\n\n• Revive the dead. {i}Reality revision{/i} can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a {i}resurrection{/i} spell.  This power can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two manifestations of {i}reality revision{/i}, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. Reality revision cannot prevent a character who is brought back to life from suffering a permanent negative level or suffering from Constitution drain.\n\n• Transport travelers. This power can lift one creature per manifester level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.\n\n• Undo misfortune. {i}Reality revision{/i} can undo a single recent event. Manifesting the power forces a reroll of any single roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.\n\nYou can try to use {i}reality revision{/i} to produce more powerful effects than these, but doing so is dangerous.  The manifestation may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.\n\nDuplicated powers allow saves and power resistance as normal (but save DCs are calculated as though the power is 9th level) and the power is treated as if manifested with 17 power points, allowing the manifester to choose any appropriate augment options.  Powers without augment options are simply manifested as normal, but with 9th level save DCs.\n\nManifesting {i}reality revision{/i} requires channeling psionic power through specially-treated crystals similar to cognizance crystals that cost 25,000 gp. The crystal is consumed in the manifestation and becomes inert, unable to be used again and losing any value. If a power or spell duplicated by {i}reality revision{/i} has a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component or additional crystals of the same value.\n\nMYTHIC POWER DESCRIPTION\n\nWhen using mythic reality revision to duplicate another power, you can duplicate a mythic psionic power you know. If you don’t know the mythic psionic power, you can expend a second use of mythic power to duplicate the mythic version of the desired power. \n  You can also produce any one of the following effects that modify or replace effects listed in the nonmythic reality revision power description: If you use mythic reality revision to remove injuries and afflictions, you can expend a number of uses of mythic power to remove that number of additional afflictions from all affected creatures.\n  If you use mythic reality revision to revive the dead, you can expend a second use of mythic power to negate the target’s permanent negative level from the resurrection.\n  Alter fate. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can manifest mythic reality revision as an immediate action before a 1d20 roll is attempted and choose what number you want to come up on the die." compset="PsiPower" summary="As {i}bend reality{/i}, but fewer limits.">

Your second mind doesn&apos;t provoke attacks of opportunity when manifesting a power, because doing so doesn&apos;t distract your primary mind.\n\nHaving a second mind is strenuous on your psyche, and your primary mind suffers a -2 manifester level penalty in any round in which the secondary mind has used its action.

You can move an object weighing no more than 250 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses or itself with a successful Will save or with power resistance. The weight can be moved across the ground or through the air. This power ends if the object is forced out of range. If you cease concentration, the object falls or stops.\n\nYou can drop a weight and pick up another during the power&apos;s duration, as long as you don&apos;t stop concentrating on maintaining the power. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if you were moving it with one hand.\n\nIf you spend at least 5 rounds concentrating on an unattended object, you can attempt to break or burst it as if making a Strength check, except that you apply your key ability modifier to the check instead of your Strength modifier.\n\nIf a creature succeeds on its Will save against this effect, either to prevent you moving the creature or an object in its possession, you cannot target another item in that creature&apos;s possession nor the creature itself unless you manifest the power again.\n\n{i}Thrust:{/i} You can affect one or more objects or creatures by concentrating your mind upon, sending them in a deadly hail at your foes-or simply by hurling your foe!

Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&apos;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three manifester levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all powers where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is power resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and power resistance.\n\nYou must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or psionic energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\n\nTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this power. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.\n\n{i}Familiarity:{/i} “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you&apos;ve been there often.  “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using powers such as remote viewing.\n\n“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you.  When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\n\n{i}On Target:{/i} You appear where you want to be.\n\n{i}Off Target:{/i} You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\n\n{i}Similar Area:{/i} You wind up in an area that&apos;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the power&apos;s range, the power simply fails instead.\n\n{i}Mishap:{/i} You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.

If the aura emanates from a psionic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).  Psionically charged locations, multiple disciplines, or strong local psionic emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.\n\n{i}Aura Strength:{/i} A psionic aura&apos;s strength depends on a functioning power&apos;s level or an item&apos;s manifester level.

If detect psionics is manifested and directed at such a location, the power indicates an aura of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).

You must make a manifesting level check (1d20 + manifester level) against the DC of each disease affecting you. Success means that the disease is cured.

  <thing id="puEctGr3" name="Ectoplasmic Grapnel, Syonique&apos;s" description="A blob of malleable, adhesive ectoplasm shoots out from your outstretched hand, attached by an ectoplasmic cord. Upon hitting its target, this ectoplasmic grapnel reels in, pulling the target to you - or you to it.\n\nWhen manifesting this power, you must have a hand free, and must make a ranged touch attack against the target; a miss causes the grapnel to retract instantly without attaching to anything. Alternately, you may have it shoot out from your shield instead of a free hand; you still get your shield&apos;s AC bonus against the target, but lose it against anyone else for the duration of the power.\n\nIf you target a creature no more than one size category larger than you, you may attempt a drag combat maneuver check. If successful, you move the creature 5 feet closer to you. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent&apos;s CMD, you can drag the target an additional 5 feet toward you. If the creature is willing, you may drag it up to 30 feet closer to you.\n\nIf you target an unattended object, you may pull it up to 30 feet towards you; if this moves it into your square, you may grasp the item immediately as a free action, although you must have a free hand to do so. If you target an attended object, the ranged touch attack is made against the opponent, and you must succeed at a disarm or steal (your choice) combat maneuver check to wrest the item free.\n\nIf you fail at the combat maneuver check (or if you target an immovable object such as a creature more than one size category larger than you, an object bolted to the floor, or a building wall, floor, or ceiling), you are instead moved up to 30 feet towards the target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternately, you may choose to relinquish your grip on the ectoplasmic cord, knocking you prone and ending the power immediately rather than moving you towards the target. If you end your movement at a climbable location (such as a wall or ledge), you must attempt a Climb check (at normal DC) to grab hold (or pull yourself over the edge, in the case of a ledge); failure means you begin falling, and must make a second Climb check with +20 DC to catch yourself.\n\nIf you spend a full-round action bracing yourself before manifesting this power, you get a +2 bonus on the above combat maneuver checks. Each adjacent ally that spends an Aid Another action to grab hold of you also adds a +2 bonus to your combat maneuver check, but also suffers the consequence of being dragged or knocked prone with you should the check fail. If the power duration should be extended beyond instantaneous (see augment below), each ally holding onto you must spend an Aid Another action each turn to maintain their hold. If you end your movement at a climbable location, each ally may make a Climb check to grab the wall, or may instead continue holding onto you; your own Climb check is penalized as normal if their combined weight drops your encumbrance into a category with a worse armor check penalty.\n\nIf you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are in control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check; failure means you are no longer grappling the creature, while success means you gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver check for each creature (besides yourself) participating in the grapple. If the drag combat maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged (or knocked prone) accordingly.\n\nIf you manifest this power while engaged in a grapple that you are not in control of, you immediately make a grapple combat maneuver check; success means you have broken free of the grapple, while failure means you are still grappling (but gain a +2 bonus to your drag combat maneuver check for each creature (besides yourself) participating in the grapple). If the drag combat maneuver check fails, you and everyone in the grapple are dragged (or knocked prone) accordingly, unless the creature grappling you is too large for you to drag (in which case the cord snaps and the power fails). The grappling creature may voluntarily release you from the grapple to avoid being dragged or knocked prone, but must do so before the combat maneuver check is rolled.\n\n{b}Augment{/b}: You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways:\n\n1. If you spend 2 additional power points, the duration increases to 1 rnd./lvl. if the ranged touch attack hits. The cord does not automatically retract; you may choose to retract or extend the cord up to 30 feet (to the limit of the power&apos;s range) as a standard action, and must succeed at a combat maneuver check each time you attempt to drag an unwilling creature in this manner. Other creatures may climb or manipulate the cord as they would a rope, but it is as strong as a chain. An unwilling creature attached to the grapnel must cut (5 hp, hardness 10, AC 10) or burst (Str DC 26) the cord to move away from you, unless he succeeds at a drag combat maneuver check to pull you behind him. If the cord is cut or burst, or if you let go of the cord (a free action), the power ends immediately.\n\n2. If you spend 2 additional power points, the range of the power increases to Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./lvl.).\n\n3. If you spend 4 additional power points, the cord retracts the full length instantly. A successful combat maneuver check, by any margin, pulls the target adjacent to you, while a failed combat maneuver check pulls you adjacent to the target (unless you relinquish the cord and go prone instead).\n\n4. For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power can drag creatures an additional size category larger than you, and the cord&apos;s hardness increases by 2, hit points increases by 10, and break DC increases by 2.\n\n5. If you spend 4 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a move action.\n\nIn addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve any of these effects, you also gain a +1 bonus on any combat maneuver checks or Climb checks you make for this power." compset="PsiPower" summary="Use a ray of ectoplasm to perform a variety of functions.">

Until the beginning of your next turn, you may make one Tiny or smaller moving object perform a trick shot&apos; -- a stunt that you describe -- so long as it is not moving under its own power (thrown objects or fired projectiles are not moving under their own power, while an insect or a flying psicrystal are). So long as the stunt can be succinctly described in ten words or less, it occurs, no matter how unlikely this is. This trick shot has no influence on attack or damage rolls, although the effect itself may allow an attack to occur. Example trick shots include the following (which are descriptive and of varying complexity; the sentences used in manifesting are shorter): - Shooting an arrow through the sockets of twelve axe heads between you and your target - Bouncing a billiard ball off of nine different fixtures (including your friend&apos;s breastplate) before sinking in a pocket - Having a crossbow bolt loop the loop before impacting normally - Forcing a tossed coin to land, perfectly stable, on its edge - Getting a javelin to slalom around trees between you and your target - Directing the tiny bead of an undetonated {i}fireball{/i} to fly a figure eight around its target&apos;s feet - Allowing a dagger, despite being pointy, to bounce off of the ground between a creature&apos;s legs and continue unhindered to its actual target behind him\n\nAdditional trick shots beyond this list are possible.\n\nFrom a combat perspective, the most powerful use of this power would be to shoot around corners, but doing so is treated as shooting blind.

This does not allow it to shoot through armor or walls (you still need clear line of effect to your target), but it does allow it to impact a target without the target noticing. A bolt that successfully hits a corporeal target embeds itself entirely in the target, but the effect is not obvious -- the bolt does no damage, and there&apos;s no entry wound.

  <thing id="puLocWi2" name="Localized Windstorm" description="Through force of will alone, you generate a small storm of psychokinetic turbulence in the air. The storm itself manifests as a wall which can intensify the existing winds in a small area, or can instead be set to exactly counter such winds, generating a peaceful area of calm. While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square walls to enclose specific points.\n\nChoose to intensify or pacify the winds when you manifest this power (although the decision can be changed when you reshape the effect, see below). Intensifying the winds creates an invisible vertical curtain of wind. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Flying creatures smaller than Medium size cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Projectiles of 1 pound or less passing through the wind wall are deflected upward and miss. For every pound above 1 of the projectile&apos;s weight, it has a 10% chance to not be blown off course. Projectiles weighing 10 lbs or more are unaffected by the wind wall. Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in {i}gaseous form{/i} cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).\n\nPacifying the winds allows you to generate a region of calm that consists of every 5 ft. cube that shares an edge or space with where the wind wall would otherwise be. These regions are treated as if their wind conditions were two categories fairer than they would naturally be, to a minimum of no winds. Additionally, if these areas of calm overlap an existing wind wall or an intensifying localized windstorm, the two effects cancel, letting normal wind conditions prevail in the square.\n\nAt any point during the duration, you may extend your concentration to a full-round action. Doing so allows you reshape the wall into any other configuration you could have chosen when you manifest this power, including the choice to intensify or pacify.\n\n{b}Augment{/b}: You may augment this power in one or more of the following ways:\n\n1.

If you spend 2 additional power points, your control over the localized windstorm increases greatly. You may reshape the wall as normal or as an immediate action. You may also generate pockets of calm interspersed with pockets of intense winds when you shape the wall (effectively, this is the intensify option except that the wall may be broken with as many 5-foot cubes of calm that you choose, as per the pacify option). 4.

You must manifest this power in response to a single attack made with a ranged weapon within medium range (the attacker must be within range, the target need not be) before the result of the attack is determined. You cannot use this power to mirror unusually massive projectiles such as siege weapons. You create four reflections of the projectile that each do damage as a mundane weapon of the original projectile&apos;s type. Each mirrored projectile uses the same attack roll result as the reflected attack to determine if they strike the target or not (regardless of their enhancement bonus to attack), and each projectile checks for concealment individually. Effects that modify the weapon or its damage, such as that from Psionic Shot or prevenom weapon, do not apply to these reflections.\n\nIf applicable, the projectiles add the Strength bonus of the original attacker under the normal constraints for the attacker&apos;s weapon (full strength bonus for thrown weapons, full strength bonus up to a certain value for composite longbows, etc). The reflections return to their native reality shortly after appearing and cannot be preserved.\n\nPrecision damage (such as sneak attack) and extra damage from critical hits only apply to the first projectile fired, not to the four reflections.

Reflecting abilities that add a flat sum to the price of the weapon cost 1 additional power point per 5000 gp of their market price to replicate. Like standard magical weapons, you may not add abilities to the reflection projectiles unless they already have at least a +1 enhancement bonus. The enhancement bonus or ability to be added must exist on the original projectile.\n\n2. For every 4 additional power points you spend, you may create an additional projectile.\n\n3.

  <thing id="psSymDea8" name="Symbol of Death" description="This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a {i}symbol of death{/i} kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The {i}symbol of death{/i} affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the {i}symbol{/i} becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points&apos; worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the {i}symbol of death{/i} is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the {i}symbol{/i} only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the {i}symbol{/i} is still active, it must save again.\n\nUntil it is triggered, the {i}symbol of death{/i} is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a {i}symbol of death{/i} must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the {i}symbol of death{/i} ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the {i}symbol of death{/i} works normally.\n\nAs a default, a {i}symbol of death{/i} is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a {i}symbol of death{/i} can&apos;t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a {i}symbol of death{/i}&apos;s triggering conditions cannot be changed.\n\nIn this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a {i}symbol of death{/i} to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can&apos;t use a {i}symbol of death{/i} offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered {i}symbol of death{/i} remains untriggered if an item bearing the {i}symbol of death{/i} is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a {i}symbol of death{/i} cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\n\nYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a {i}symbol of death{/i} can be based on a creature&apos;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don&apos;t qualify.\n\nWhen scribing a {i}symbol of death{/i}, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol&apos;s effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune&apos;s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\n\nYou also can attune any number of creatures to the {i}symbol of death{/i}, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a {i}symbol of death{/i} cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own {i}symbols of death{/i}, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\n\n{i}Read magic{/i} allows you to identify a {i}symbol{/i} with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the {i}symbol&apos;s{/i} spell level). Of course, if the {i}symbol{/i} is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\n\nA {i}symbol of death{/i} can be removed by a successful {i}dispel magic{/i} targeted solely on the rune. An {i}erase{/i} spell has no effect on a {i}symbol of death{/i}. Destruction of the surface where a {i}symbol of death{/i} is inscribed destroys the {i}symbol{/i} but also triggers it.\n\n{i}Symbol of death{/i} can be made permanent with a {i}permanency{/i} spell. A permanent {i}symbol of death{/i} that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.\n\n{i}Note{/i}: Magic traps such as {i}symbol of death{/i} are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a {i}symbol of death{/i} and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for {i}symbol of death{/i}." compset="PsiPower">
