      6/14/2014 - Tim Shadow
      -Fixed MW/Magical catapults not picking up weight and not becoming equipable.
      -New Adjustments for affecting all hardness for rigging and all HP.

      3/9/2014 - Tim Shadow
      -Fixed "Speed" to display half knots so that small speed difference between ships is shown.
      -Added a "Fire as She Bears" activation for "Getting the Guage" and "Aboard a moving Ship".  When Razor Coast is active all characters will now have two new activations they can turn on.
      --Getting the Guage: Gives a bonus to any Siege engines on a character. Add gives a situational note that your Naval Initiative check is two higher.
      --Aboard a moving Ship: Gives a -4 to hit with ranged attacks or -2 if you have Navel Gunnary feat.
      -Fixed all Cannons again.
      -Siege engines will now be equipable on the iPad so that players can actually use the ipad to roll attacks.
      -Siege Engine (Catapults) will not correctly use your Knowledge (Engineering) skill total to calculate the attack roll.

      2/22/2014 - Tim Shadow
      -Fixed "Speeds" that where reverised.
      -Added "Ship Type" so that the type of ship can be entered and it will change the Race Name.
      -Always hide the "Unarmed Strike" weapon for the Fire as she Bears ship.
      -Prevent Bluff, Diplomacy, disguise, and intimidate skills from going to statblock for the Fire as she Bears ship.
      -Lots of statblock text desc fixes for Fire as She Bears ships.
      -Added Skull and Shackles ship equipment.
      -Added more FasB ship equipment.
      -Lots of misc script fixes for FasB.
      -Added weights for Siege Engines into the game.  They will display the weight after you added the weapon to the ship.]]></info_history>
