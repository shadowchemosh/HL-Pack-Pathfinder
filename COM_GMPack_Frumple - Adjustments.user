      January 31, 2015 - Tim Shadow
      -Removed the Protection From Energy adjustment thingid.pProtEnerg as a one was officially added in Pathfinder 10.13.

      Oct 30, 2014 - Jeff Hersh
      Added the following:
      id="pCBAbilAct" name="Ability: Activate"
      id="pCBFastHea" name="Fast Healing (adjust)"

      May 21, 2014 - Tim Shadow
      -Merged in the following from Frumple's Adjustment file v2.20.
      id="puSplLkDay" name="Spell-Like Ability (per day)"
      id="puAbilForc" name="Ability Score (Forced)"
      id="pCBFlyManu" name="Flight Maneuverability"
      id="sCBFlyPoor" name="Poor"
      id="sCBFlyGood" name="Good"
      id="sCBFlyAver" name="Average"
      id="sCBFlyPerf" name="Perfect"
      id="sCBFlyClum" name="Clumsy"
      id="pCBRmClssk" name="Class Skill, Remove"
      id="pCBSnkAtk" name="Race Ability, Sneak Attack"
      id="pCBProfGif" name="Profane Gift"
      id="pCBEvasion" name="Evasion"
      id="pCBRemSpd" name="Speed, Remove"


      December 28, 2013 - Tim Shadow
      -Removed "pTransform" adjustment as it was officially added in Pathfinder v8.5.

      August 11, 2013 - Tim Shadow
      -Merged in "xCBDmRdCdM" which is an id change from "xDamRdCldM". Problem is DR's are attached to all characters and I don't feel like breaking every single .por file ever made against the CB.
      -"Racial Caster Level" fixed so that it does not through errors. After using setfocus one must check for doneif (state.isfocus = 0) or if a massive error can get thrown.
      -"Number of Attacks" moved over to my adjustments file and name changed to "Natural Weapons: Number of Attacks".


      June 4, 2013 - Tim Shadow
      -Removed "pACNatural" Armor Class: Natural as it was added officially with the exact name Unqiue ID and we clashed against pathfinder v7.13.

      May 13, 2013 - Tim Shadow
      -Merged over id="puTotSpeed" name="Speed, Total" and id="puBtQuadru" name="Body Type: Quadruped".

      March 17, 2013 - Tim Shadow
      -Moved out the Elven Chain to the new PFRPG_PlayerPack_equipment.user file as I found we had mulitple copies of Elven Chain in the data set.
      -Moved over all the Adjustments from the "PFRPG_Bestiary_UniversialAbilities.user" file as it was causing me issues with the Player Pack migration.

      March 12, 2013 - Tim Storen
      -Moved thingid.puRmClsSk "Remove Class Skill" over to my "Shadow" adjustments file so that lots of people can get access to it. Updated the .por files that used this adjustment.  Also renamed it to "Class Skill, Remove" to match HL naming convetions.

      March 6, 2013 - Tim Storen
      -Merged in "Remove Class Skill"
      -Moved thingid.puRmClsSk "Remove Class Skill" over to my "Shadow" adjustments file so that lots of people can get access to it.

      Feb 2, 2013 - Tim Storen
      -Fixed Transformation bug that came back again. 
      -Added Conditions to Transformation's Feats that are bootstraped so when the ability is turned off the feats go away.
      -Added the Product ID of HL Community to all over Adjustments.

      Nov 24, 2012 - Jeff Hersh
      Fixed Transformation bug.

      June 18, 2012 - Jeff Hersh
      Added DR x/cold iron or magic

      June 4, 2012 - Jeff Hersh
      Added Regneration
      Added Increase Damage Die
      Added Natural AC adjustment

      Mar 30, 2012 - Jeff Hersh
      Added adjustment for transformation spell

      feb 20, 2012 - Jeff Hersh
      Added adjustments for channel resistance and BAB

      Feb 12, 2012 - Jeff Hersh
      Added Jump and Fast Healing adjustments

      Feb 8, 2012 - Jeff Hersh
      Added a base weapon for improvised weapons with 1d4 damage
      Added goodberry as a wondrous item (for goodberry spell)

      Feb 5, 2012 - Tim Shadow
      -Created this file from "PFRPG_Frumple_bonuses.user".
      -Added in just the Adjustments stuff.]]></info_history>

He can build new memories, but any memories that existed before he became an amnesiac are suppressed.\n\nWorse, the amnesiac loses all class abilities, feats, and skill ranks for as long as his amnesia lasts. He retains his base attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses, combat maneuver bonus, combat maneuver defense, total experience points, and hit dice (and hit points), but everything else is gone until the amnesia is cured. If a character gains a class level while suffering from amnesia, he may use any abilities gained by that class level normally. If the class level he gained was of a class he already possess levels in, he gains the abilities of a 1st-level character of that class, even though he is technically of a higher level in that class. If his amnesia is later cured, he regains all the full abilities of this class, including those gained from any levels taken while he was suffering from amnesia." compset="InPlay">

The number of additional personalities the victim manifests equals the DC of the insanity divided by 10 (round down, minimum of 1 additional personality). Should the insanity worsen in some way (such as by the save DC increasing), the number of additional personalities increases as well. Likewise, the number of additional personalities decreases as the sufferer recovers and the insanity&apos;s DC decreases. The GM should develop these additional personalities.\n\nEvery morning, and each time the afflicted character is rendered unconscious, he must make a Will save against his insanity&apos;s DC. Failure indicates that a different personality takes over. A character&apos;s memories and skills remain unchanged, but the various personalities have no knowledge of each other and will deny, often violently, that these other personalities exist." compset="InPlay">
