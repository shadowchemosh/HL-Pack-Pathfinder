  <thing id="tmPUAuEgop" name="Egophile" description="When creatures die while engaging in extreme emotional repression, sometimes their souls become something... else. Only barely resembling what it once was, an egophile wears the faces of its emotional conquests as a visible shroud, taking pleasure and sustenance in devouring the hopes and dreams of the living. It delights in turning those especially prone to logical thought or empathy into husks - those emptied of that which most made them unique. In a truly cruel twist, egophiles enslave these husks, claiming their individuality and uniqueness as just another body to wear and discard.\n\nEncounters with egophiles should never be straightforward, and should never be a single fight. By design, egophiles are incredibly difficult to pin down, watching and learning all they can of their opponents through the eyes of their sacrificial husks. They are far more clever than classically intelligent, and understand the value of throwing waves of expendable allies at enemies to wear them down before finishing them personally. Any pride or ego the egophile once had, it lost in its transformation - it has little desire to answer challenges itself, and feels no shame in fleeing a losing battle. The sample egophile is an aged warrior, having taken his own life in service to his lord and his honor, despite his own doubts. After his death and subsequent rebirth, his lord and all of his members of the court became his first husks - not out of a sense of vengeance, but out of the convenience of proximity." compset="Template" uniqueness="unique">

The victim rises from death as a husk on its next turn. If the creature was slain by having its Intelligence drained to 0, it becomes an empty husk. If the creature was slain by having its Charisma drained to 0, it becomes a shattered husk. If the creature was slain by the egophile&apos;s devour psyche, it becomes either type, chosen by the egophile when it rises. This husk is under the command of the egophile that created it, and remains enslaved until its master&apos;s destruction. An egophile may have enslaved husks totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any husks it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. An egophile may free an enslaved husk in order to enslave a new husk, but once freed, an egophile or husk cannot be enslaved again. While a husk is enslaved to an egophile, if viewed astrally, it possesses a muddy golden thread linking it to the egophile. Husks remain members of their previous types, but gain the augmented subtype, and their stats change to mirror those in the husk entry." compset="RaceSpec">

It uses all of the husk&apos;s statistics, including hit points and armor class, except for Will saves and skill checks based on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. An egophile possessing a husk retains its egophile special attacks and any strictly mental abilities, including psionics. While a husk is possessed by an egophile, it manifests obvious signs of the egophile&apos;s presence (usually the cloak of faces). If an egophile is possessing a husk when the husk is killed, the egophile is ejected into a square adjacent to the husk.\n\nGenerally speaking, egophiles do not venture from the safety of a husk body. Having lost many of their own senses, they delight in the sensations gained through this possession, and will almost always be encountered within a husk. Should they be deprived of a husk body to flee to, they will generally flee themselves - their first priority being to create more husks." compset="RaceSpec">
